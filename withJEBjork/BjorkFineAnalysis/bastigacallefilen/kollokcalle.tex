Let $\mathcal H$ be a complex and separable Hilbrt space.
Every   denumerabla  orthonormal basis
in $\mathcal H$ identifies
the Hilbert space with
$\ell^2$ which therefore is a universal model for
separable Hilbert spaces.
Vectors in $\ell^2$ consists
of sequences of complex numbers
$x=\{c_n\}$ for which
\[
||x||= \sqrt{\,\sum_{n=1}^\infty\, |c_n|^2}<\infty
\]
If $V$ is a dense subspace of
a separable Hilbert space it follows via the Gram-Schmidt
construction that $V$ contains an orthonomal basis for
$\mathcal H$. 
It follows that if $T$ is an arbitrary densely defined linear
operator on
$\mathcal H$, i.e. if the domain of defintion
$\mathcal D(T)$ is dense in
$\mathcal H$ then we can  take $\mathcal H=\ell^2$ where
$\mathcal D(T)$ contains  the basis vectors $\{e_n\}$.
This gives an infinite matrix with elements  $\{a_{pq}\}$ such that
\[
T(e_p)=\sum_{q=1}^\infty\, a_{pq}\cdot e_q\tag{0.1}
\]
hold for every $p=1,2,\ldots$.
Notice that 0.1)  gives
\[
||Te_p||^2=\sum_{q=1}^\infty\, |a_{pq}|^2
\]
Thus, every row vector in the matrix belongs to
$\ell^2$.
We are going to study  Hermitian matrices where  the doubly-indexed
elements satisfy
\[
a_{qp}= \overline{a_{pq}}
\]
for all pairs of positive integers.
In addition we assume that  every row vector belongs to
$\ell^2$ and since  the matrix is Hermitian  the same hold for
every column vector.
If $x$ is an arbitrary $\ell^2$-vector, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives
\[
\sum_{q=1}^\infty\, |a_{pq}|\cdot |x_q|<\infty
\]
for every fixed $p$.
Hence every $x\in\ell^2$ yields a vector $y=\{y_p\}$ with
\[
y_p= \sum_{q=1}^\infty\, a_{pq}\cdot x_q
\]
In  general this $y$-vector does not belong to
$\ell^2$.
So one is led to study the set of $x$-vectors for which
\[
\sum_{p=1}^\infty\, |\sum_{q=1}^\infty\, a_{pq}\cdot x_q|^2<\infty\tag{0.2}
\]
The set of such vectors is a subspace of $\ell^2$ which containing
the basis vectors $\{e_n\}$ and is therefore a dense subspace of
$\ell^2$. Hence the Hermitian matrix $A$  yields a densely defined
linear operator
whose domain of definition
$\mathcal D(A)$ is the set of vectors $x$ for which (0.2) hold
The question arises  if
the Hermitian  condition of  the matrix implies that
\[
(Ax,y)= (x,Ay)\tag{*}
\]
hold for every pair $x,y$ in $\mathcal D(A)$.
It turns out that (*) is not always satisfied, i.e. there exists
Hermitian matrices   where (*) fails.
A specific example will be  given  in ¤ xx.

{\bf{Self-adjoint operators.}}
When (*) holds one refers to $A$ as a
self-adjoint operator.
We are going to study this family of operators and also find
equivalent conditions to (*).
But first we
announce some results
where (*) is not assumed, i.e.
$A$ is an arbitrary  hermitian matrix
whose colums belong to $\ell^2$
so that $\mathcal D(A)$ is a dense subspace
which contains all finite $\ell^2$-vectors $\bold x$, i.e.  those vectors  for which
$x_p\neq 0$ only hold for a finite set of integers.
Let us denote this subspace of $\ell^2$ by $\ell^2(*)$.
Now onwe has:
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Proposition}}
\emph{For each pair $x\in \mathcal D(A)$ and $z\in \ell^2(*)$ one has the equality}
\[
\langle Ax,z\rangle= \langle x,Az\rangle
\]
The proof is left as an exercise to the reader.
Using this one gets a useful description of $\mathcal D(A)$:
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Proposition}}
\emph{A vector $x$ belongs to $\mathcal D(A)$ if and only if there
exists a constant such that}
\[
\langle x,Az\rangle\leq C\cdot ||x||\,\colon\, z\in \ell^2(*)
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise}} Prove this result. The hint s to use that
the Hilbert space $\ell^2$ is self-dual.

\medskip


\noindent
Let us now consider a complex number
$\lambda$ with a non-zero imaginary part.
Then we shall prove :
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Proposition.}}
\emph{For each vector 
$y\in \ell^2$ there exists at least oone
vector $x\in\mathcal D(A)$ such that}
\[
Ax=\lambda\cdot x+y\tag{*}
\]
\emph{Moreover we can find $x$ so that}
\[
||x||\leq \frac{1}{|Im(\lambda)|}\cdot ||y||
\]

{\bf{A.0. Proposition}}\emph{For every hermimtisn mstrix
the operator $A$ has a closed range, and the equaation}
\[
A(x)=\lambda|cdot x+f
\]
\emph{has at least one solution $x\in\mathcal D(A)$ whenever
$f\in\ell^2$ and $\lambda$ is a non-real complex number.
Morveover, we can find
a solution vector $x$ where}
\[
||x||\leq \frac{1}{|\mathfrak{Im}\lambda|}\cdot ||f||
\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
To each posiotivie integer $N$ we denote by
$A_N$ the $N\times N$-mastrix with elements $\{a_{pq}\colon\,
1\leq p,q\leq N\}$.
Next, figen
$f\in \ell^p2$. Linear slgebra gives for every
$N\geq 1$ a unique $N$-vrvtor
$x=(x_1,\ldots,x_N)$  such thst
\[
\sum_{q=1}^{q=N}\, a_{pq}x_q=
\lambda x_p+f_p\quad 1\leq p\leq N
\]
The $N$-vecotr $x$ depends on $N$ and is denoted by
$x(N)$. It can be identified with
a vector in $\ell^2$
whose $e_p$-componnts are zeroi for all $p>N$.
Moreover, Linesr Algebr appiled to the Hermitisn matrix
$A_N$ also gives
\[
||x(N)||\leq\frac{1}{|\mathfrak{Im}\lambda|}\cdot ||f||
\]
Hence $\{x(N)\}$ is a bounded sewuence in
$\ell^2$. Now we recsl, thst every bounded
$\ell^2$-sewuence ciontsins at least one weakly convergent ubsewuence.
So there exits a strictly increasing sequence
$N_1<N_2<\ldots$ snd $x\in \ell^2$ suvy thst
\[
x(N_j)\overset{w}\to x
\]
For every finxed $p$ we see that (i) and the equations (ii) imply that
\[
\sum_{q=1}^\infty \, a_{pq}x_q=\lambda x_p+f_p
\]
Put $y_p= \sum_{q=1}^\infty \, a_{pq}x_q$. Then (i) gives
\[
|y_p|^2\leq 2|\lambda|^2\cdot |x_p|^2+2|f_p|^2
\]
for every $p$. It follows that the vevtor
$y=\{y_p\}$ blongd to $\ell^2$ snd hence
$x\in\mathcal D(A)$. At this stsge the reader csn check thst
$Ax=\lambda x+f$ which gives a solution to (*) in
Proposition xx.
Finally, the  proof thst
the graph 
\[
\Gamma(A)=\{(x,Ax)\colon\, x\in \mathcal D(A)\}
\]
is a closed subspace of
$\ell^2|times\ell^2$ is left to the reader.

\bigskip

PROOF

\bigskip


\noindent
In [Ca] a Hermitsin mstrix for which
(1)-(3) hold  for the associated densely defined operstor$A$ is referred to as \emph{Case 1}.
Here we use the contemporary vocabulsriy and say that
$A$ is self-djoint when
(1.3) above hold.
Notoce that (3) means thst
$A$ can be approximated by
the operators $\{A_N\}$ in a rsther strong sense.
This approximation leads to the existence of other limits
which
culminate in a spectral resolution of $A$.
More precisely, the jaoro result from [Ca] goes as follows.
Assume thst
$A$ is self-adjoint.
Then the folloeing exist. Firt, to every
$t\geq 0$ one finds a bounded self.adjoint projection $E^+_t$
where
\[
s>t\implies E_sE_t=E_t
\]
Moroever, the rsnge of $E_t$ is contsin in
$\mathcal D(A)$ for every $t$ and
\[
E_t(Ax)= A(E_tx)\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(A)
\]
Mrover $ AE_t£$ is an everywhere bounded linear operstor 
on
$\ell^2$ whose sepcttum satisfied the includuin
\[
\sigma(AE_t)\subset  [0,t]
\]
Next, for every finxed vector $x\in \ell^2$ the funvtion
\[
t\mapsto (E_tx,x)
\] is non-decreading and
the fsmily $\{E_t\}$ can be chosen so that
these functions are left continuous, i.e.
\[
\lim_{\delta\to 0}(E_{t-\delta} x,x)= (E_tx,x)
\]
hold for every $t>0$.
Next, for every $x\in\ell^2$ and each $T>=$ there exists
the Stieltjes' integral
\[
\int_0^T\, t\cdot \frac{d}{dt}(E_t,x,x)
\]
If $x\in\mathcal D(A)$ then 
the limit of these integrals is finite as $T\to\infty$, i.e.
\[
\int_0^\infty\, t\cdot \frac{d}{dt}(E_t,x,x)<\infty
\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(T)
\]
Finslly there exists a self-adjoint operstor
$A^?$ where $\mathcal D(A^*?$ contsins $\mathcal D(A)$ snd for
eavh psir $x,y$ in $\mathcal D(A)$ one has
\[
(Ax,y)=\int_0^\infty \, t\cdot \frac{d}{dt}(E_tx,y)
\]




















\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The operator $A_*$.}}
Denote by $\ell^2_*$ the subspace of $\ell^2$ whose vectors
are fiunite ${\bf{C}}$-linesr combintiond of
the $e$-vectors.
The given matrix yields  a linesr operstor
$A_*$ whose domain of definition is $\ell^2_*$.
If $x$ and $y$ is a pair of vectors in
$\ell^2_*$ we find an integer $N$ so thst
both belong to the subspace genersted by $e-1,\ldots,e_N$ snd then
\[
(A_*x,y_*)= \sum_{p=1}^{q=N}\,
a_{pq}x_q\overline{y_p}
\]
Since the matrix is Hermitian  one sees thst
(i) is equal ton $(x,A_*y)$.
So the densely defined operator $A_*$ is symmetric.
Next, consider its graph
\[
\Gamma(A_*)= \{(x,A_*x)\,\colon\, x\in \ell^2_*\}
\]
and  take its closure in
the product space $\ell^2\times \ell^2$.
This closure is graphic, i.e. there exists
a linesr operstor
$\overline{A_*}$
such that
\[
\overline{\Gamma(A_*)}=
\Gamma(\overline{A_*})
\]
The easy verification is left to the reader.
So here
$\overline{A_*}$ is another densely defined operator and
agsin we leave the esy verificstion thst it is symmetric, i.e.
\[ 
\overline{A_*}x,y)=(x,\overline{A_*}y)
\]
hold for every pair $x,y$ in
$\mathcal D(\overline{A_*})$.
We shall also need a description
$\mathcal D(A)$.
Namely, let $y\in \ell^2$ and suppose there exists
a constsnt $C$ such thst
\[
|(Ax,y)|\leq C||x||\quad\colon\, x\in\ell^2_*
\]
It means thst
$x\mapsto (Ax,y)$ is a bounded linesr functionsl on
$\ell^2_*$ which by density extends  to
a boundd linesr funvionsl on
$\ell^2$. Now this Hilbert space ios self-dusl and hence there
exists a uniwue vector $\xi$ such thst
\[
(x,\xi)= (Ax,y)\quad\colon\quad x\in \ell^2_*
\]
Applied to the case when
$x$ run over the basis vctors one chscks thst
$\xi=Ay$ and that (x) gives a
\emph{necessary and sufficient} confition in order that
$y$ belong to $\mathcal D(A)$.
\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}Show also thst
$A$ is closed, i.e. its graph $\Gamma(A)$ is
closed in $\ell^2\times\ell^2$.
\medskip

\noindent
Since we have the trivisl inclsuion
$\gamma(A_*)\subset \Gamma(A)$ it followd from
the exercise that
$A$ is abn extension of $\overline{A_*}$, i.e. one has
the inclsuuon
\[
\Gamma(\overline{}A_*)\subset \Gamma(A)
\]
At this stage we estsblish a crucial result.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}\emph{The equality (*) holds if and only if
the null spaces of $iE+A$ and $iE-A$ are both zero.}
\medskip


\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Suppose first that (*) holds. If
for example $iE-A$ has a non-trivsl nullspace we find
$0\neq x$ and
\[
ix=Ax\implies i\cdot (Ax,x)= (x,Ax)= (x,ix)=-i(x,x)
\]
which gives a contradiction.
In the same way one checks thst
$iE+A$ has a trivial null-space.
Conversely, assume that
both $iE+A$ snd $iE-A$ have trivial null-spaces.
Now we prove thst this gives
the equality
\[
\Gamma(\overline{}A_*)=\Gamma(A)
\]
Namely, if the inclsuion from (xx)nis strict
we find a vector $y\in\mathcal D(A)$ such that
$(y,Ay)$ is $\perp$ to
the closed graph of
$\overline{A_*}$. In particular
\[
(x,y)+(Ax,Ay)=0\quad\colon\forall\, x\in \ell^2_*
\]
Now (i) implies that
\[
|(Ax,Ay)|\leq ||y||\cdot |x||
\]
so by the criterion in
xxx we condlude thst
$Ay$ belongs to
$\mathcal D(A)$ and (xx) gives
\[
(x,y)+(x,A^2y)=0\quad\colon\forall\, x\in \ell^2_*
\]
Since $\ell^2_*$ is dense in
$\ell^2$ thid entails thst
$y+A^2y=$ which  means that
\[
(E+iA)\cdot(A-iA)(y)=0
\]
But then thr nullspace of
$E+iA$ or $E-iA$ must be non.-trivial
whivh finishes the proof of Theorem xx.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Conclusion.}}
We have alreay seen thst
$\overline{A_*}$ is symmetric. when its graph is equal to
$\Gamma(A)$ it follows that
$A$ also is symmetric, i.e.
\[
(Ax,y)= (x,Ay)\quad\colon x,y\in\mathcal D(A)
\]
Moreover, when (xx) holds it follows exactly as in
(xx) that  the null-spaces of $E+iA$ snd $E-iA$ are both trivial.
\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{A surjectivity theorem.}}
Consider as aobe a Hermitisn mstrix which
gives the densely defined and symmetric operator $\overline{A_*}$.
Here we do not assume that the null-spaces of 
$E+iA$ and $iE-A$ both are trivisl.
However, it turns out the range of
$iE+\overline{A_*}$ and of 
$iE-\overline{A_*}$ both are equal to $\ell^2$.
In fat, more generslly we consider an inhomogrnoueus equstion
\[
\overline{A_*}x=\lambda\cdot \overline{A_*}+y
\]
where $y$ is a vector in
$\ell^2$ and $\lambda$ is a complex number eith
non-zxero imsginsry part,.
 We shall prove thst
(xx) has at leat one solution $x$
whose norm satisfies
\[
||x||\leq \frac{1}{\mathfrak{Im}\lambda}\cdot ||y||
\]
\medskip

DO IT !!!
\medskip

\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{The normal resolvent operators.}}
Now we assume that
$A$ is self-adjoint.
From (xx) it follows that
the operstopr
\[
x\mapsto ix-Ax
\]
its inverse operstor is bounded eith
whose  operstor norm is $\leq 1$.
Put
\[
R=(iE-A)^{-1}
\]
As exposed in ¤ xx it means thst
$R$ is a resolvent  in the sense of Neumann
attwched to the resolvent vslue $i$ of the densely defined
operstor $A$.
In the same way we find thr bounded operstor
\[
S= (iE+A)^{-1}
\]
Next, thr bnounded operstor $R$ has an adjoint $R^*$ snd we shall
prove the equslity
\[
R^*=S
\]
To attain this we consider a pair
of vectors $x,y$ in $\ell^2_*$.
Now
\[
iR(x)+A\circ R(x)=x\implies
\]
\[
(x,y)= i(Rx,y)+(A\circ Rx,y)=i(x,R^*y)+(Rx,Ay)=
-(x,i\cdot R^*y)+(Rx,R^Ay)
\]
Since this hold for every
$x\in \ell^*2_*$ it follows that
\[
y=-iR(y)+R\cdot A(y)
\]
and here $y\in \ell^2_*$ is arbitrary which proves that
$R^*=S$.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Conclusion.}}
Recal,l from Neumann's calculus in ¤ xx thst
reovents of an rbitasry densely defined  oopertor commute.
Applied to the two resovlents $R$ snd $S$
it follows in partioculsr that
$R$ commutes eith its adjoint, i.e. $R$ is a normal operator.
Stsrting from this
the spectral resolution of the self-adjoint operator follows via
Hilbert's  spectral theorem for bounded normal operator in  ¤ xx.



\newpage
















The proof rewuires some preliminary obervations.
Denote by $\ell^2_*$ the subspace of $\ell^2$ whose vectors
are fiunite ${\bf{C}}$-linesr combintiond of
the $e$-vectors.
The given matrix now defines a linesr operstor
$A_*$ whose domain of definition is $\ell^2_*$.
If $x$ and $y$ is a pair of vectors in
$\ell^2_*$ we find an integer $N$ so thst
both belong to the subspace genersted by $e-1,\ldots,e_N$ snd thrn
\[
(A_*x,y_*)= \sum_{p=1}^{q=N}\,
a_{pq}x_q\overline{y_p}
\]
Since the matrix is Hermitian  one sees thst
(i) is equal ton $(x,A_*y)$.
So the densely defined operator $A_*$ is symmetric.
Next, we can consider its graph
\[
\Gamma(A_*)= \{(x,A_*x)\,\colon\, x\in \ell^2_*\}
\]
and then take its closure in
the product space $\ell^2\times \ell^2$.
This closure is grsphic, i.e. there exists
a linesr operstor
$\overline{A_*}$
such that
\[
\overline{\Gamma(A_*)}=
\Gamma(\overline{A_*})
\]
The easy verification is left to the reader.
So here
$\overline{A_*}$ is another densely defined operator and
agsin we leave the esy verificstion thst it is symmetric, i.e.
\[ 
\overline{A_*}x,y)=(x,\overline{A_*}y)
\]
hold for every pair $x,y$ in
$\mathcal D(\overline{A_*})$.
























\noindent
Let $\mathcal H$ be a complex and separsble Hilbrt space.
Every   denumerabla  orthonormal basis
in $\mathcal H$ identifies
the Hiblert space weith
$\ell^2$ which therefore is a universal model for
separable Hilbert spaces.
vectors in $\ell^2$ consists
of sequences of complex numbers
$x=\{c_n\}$ for which
\[
||x||= \sqrt{\,\sum_{n=1}^\infty\, |c_n|^2}<\infty
\]
If $V$ is a dense subspace of
a separsble Hilbert space it follows via the Gram-Schmidt
condtruction that $V$ contsins an orthonomal basis for
$\mathcal H$. This means that the pair $(\mathcal H,V)$ always csn
be realised by
$\ell^2$ and a subspace which contsins all the basis vectors
$e:1,e_2,\ldots$.
It follows that if $T$ is an arbitrary densely defined linesr
operator on
$\mathcal H$, i.e. if the domsin of defintion
$\mathcal D(T)$ is dense in
$\mathcal H$ then we may take $\mathcal H=\ell^2$ where
$\mathcal D(T)$ contains  the basis vrctors $\{e_n\}$.
This gives an infinite matrix with elements  $\{a_{pq}\}$ such thst
\[
T(e_p)=\sum_{q=1}^\infty\, a_{pq}\cdot e_q\tag{0.1}
\]
hold for every $p=1,2,\ldots$.
Notice thst (0.1)  gives
\[
||Te_p||^2=\sum_{q=1}^\infty\, |a_{pq}|^2
\]
Thus, every row vector in the matrix belongs to
$\ell^2$.
We are going to study infinite Hermitisn mstrices,m i-e- the double-indexed
elements satisfy
\[
a_{qp}= \overline{a_{pq}}
\]
for all pairs of positive integers.
In addition we assume that  every row vector belongs to
$\ell^2$ and since  the matrix is Hermitian  the same hold for
every column vector.
If $x$ is an arbitrary $\ell^2$-vector, the Cacuhy-Schwarz inequality gives
\[
\sum_{q=1}^\infty\, |a_{pq}|\cdot |x_q|<\infty
\]
fr every fixed $p$.
So every $x\in\ell^2$ yields a vector $y=\{y_p\}$ with
\[
y_p= \sum_{q=1}^\infty\, a_{pq}|\cdot x_q
\]
In  general this $y$-vector does not belong to
$\ell^2$.
So one is led to study the set of $x$-vectors for which
\[
\sum_{p=1}^\infty\, |\sum_{q=1}^\infty\, a_{pq}|\cdot x_q|^2<\infty\tag{0.2}
\]
The set of such vectors is a subspace of $\ell^2$ which contsins
the basis vectors $\{e_n\}$ and is therefore a dense subspace of
$\ell^2$. Hence the Hermitian matrix yields a densely defined
linesr operator
$A$ where
$\mathcal A$ is the set of vectors $x$ for which (0.2) hold
The question arises  if
the Hermitian  condition of  the matrix implies that
\[
(Ax,y)= (x,Ay)\tag{*}
\]
hold for every pair $x,y$ in $\mathcal D(A)$.
It turns out that (*) is not always satisfied, i.e. there exists
a Hermitian mstrix as above where (*) fails.
A specific example is given  in ¤ xx.

{\bf{Self-adjoint operstors.}}
When (*) holds one refers to $A$ as a densely defined
self-adjoint operator.
We are going to study this family of operators and also find
equivalent conditions to (*).
But first we
announce some results about
$A$ where (*) is not assumed.

{\bf{A.0. Proposition}}\emph{For every hermimtisn mstrix

\[
A(x)=\lambda|cdot x+f

\emph{has at least one solution $x\in\mathcal D(A)$ whenever

Morveover, we can find
a solution vector $x$ where}
\[
||x||\leq \frac{1}{|\mathfrak{Im}\lambda|}\cdot ||f||
\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
To each posiotivie integer $N$ we denote by
$A_N$ the $N\times N$-mastrix with elements $\{a_{pq}\colon\,
1\leq p,q\leq N\}$.
Next, figen
$f\in \ell^p2$. Linear slgebra gives for every
$N\geq 1$ a unique $N$-vrvtor
$x=(x_1,\ldots,x_N)$  such thst
\[
\sum_{q=1}^{q=N}\, a_{pq}x_q=
\lambda x_p+f_p\quad 1\leq p\leq N
\]
The $N$-vecotr $x$ depends on $N$ and is denoted by
$x(N)$. It can be identified with
a vector in $\ell^2$
whose $e_p$-componnts are zeroi for all $p>N$.
Moreover, Linesr Algebr appiled to the Hermitisn matrix
$A_N$ also gives
\[
||x(N)||\leq\frac{1}{|\mathfrak{Im}\lambda|}\cdot ||f||
\]
Hence $\{x(N)\}$ is a bounded sewuence in
$\ell^2$. Now we recsl, thst every bounded
$\ell^2$-sewuence ciontsins at least one weakly convergent ubsewuence.
So there exits a strictly increasing sequence
$N_1<N_2<\ldots$ snd $x\in \ell^2$ suvy thst
\[
x(N_j)\overset{w}\to x
\]
For every finxed $p$ we see that (i) and the equations (ii) imply that
\[
\sum_{q=1}^\infty \, a_{pq}x_q=\lambda x_p+f_p
\]
Put $y_p= \sum_{q=1}^\infty \, a_{pq}x_q$. Then (i) gives
\[
|y_p|^2\leq 2|\lambda|^2\cdot |x_p|^2+2|f_p|^2
\]
for every $p$. It follows that the vevtor
$y=\{y_p\}$ blongd to $\ell^2$ snd hence
$x\in\mathcal D(A)$. At this stsge the reader csn check thst
$Ax=\lambda x+f$ which gives a solution to (*) in
Proposition xx.
Finally, the  proof thst
the graph 
\[
\Gamma(A)=\{(x,Ax)\colon\, x\in \mathcal D(A)\}
\]
is a closed subspace of
$\ell^2|times\ell^2$ is left to the reader.

(1)-(3) hold  for the associated densely defined operstor$A$ is referred to as \emph{Case 1}.
Here we use the contemporary vocabulsriy and say that
$A$ is self-djoint when
(1.3) above hold.
Notoce that (3) means thst
$A$ can be approximated by
the operators $\{A_N\}$ in a rsther strong sense.
This approximation leads to the existence of other limits
which
culminate in a spectral resolution of $A$.
More precisely, the jaoro result from [Ca] goes as follows.
Assume thst
$A$ is self-adjoint.
Then the folloeing exist. Firt, to every
$t\geq 0$ one finds a bounded self.adjoint projection $E^+_t$
where
\[
s>t\implies E_sE_t=E_t
\]
Moroever, the rsnge of $E_t$ is contsin in
$\mathcal D(A)$ for every $t$ and
\[
E_t(Ax)= A(E_tx)\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(A)
\]
Mrover $ AE_t£$ is an everywhere bounded linear operstor 
on
$\ell^2$ whose sepcttum satisfied the includuin
\[
\sigma(AE_t)\subset  [0,t]
\]
Next, for every finxed vector $x\in \ell^2$ the funvtion
\[
t\mapsto (E_tx,x)
\] is non-decreading and
the fsmily $\{E_t\}$ can be chosen so that
these functions are left continuous, i.e.
\[
\lim_{\delta\to 0}(E_{t-\delta} x,x)= (E_tx,x)
\]
hold for every $t>0$.
Next, for every $x\in\ell^2$ and each $T>=$ there exists
the Stieltjes' integral
\[
\int_0^T\, t\cdot \frac{d}{dt}(E_t,x,x)
\]
If $x\in\mathcal D(A)$ then 
the limit of these integrals is finite as $T\to\infty$, i.e.
\[
\int_0^\infty\, t\cdot \frac{d}{dt}(E_t,x,x)<\infty
\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(T)
\]
Finslly there exists a self-adjoint operstor
$A^?$ where $\mathcal D(A^*?$ contsins $\mathcal D(A)$ snd for
eavh psir $x,y$ in $\mathcal D(A)$ one has
\[
(Ax,y)=\int_0^\infty \, t\cdot \frac{d}{dt}(E_tx,y)
\]

\noindent
{\bf{The operator $A_*$.}}
Denote by $\ell^2_*$ the subspace of $\ell^2$ whose vectors
are fiunite ${\bf{C}}$-linesr combintiond of
the $e$-vectors.
The given matrix yields  a linesr operstor
$A_*$ whose domain of definition is $\ell^2_*$.
If $x$ and $y$ is a pair of vectors in
$\ell^2_*$ we find an integer $N$ so thst
both belong to the subspace genersted by $e-1,\ldots,e_N$ snd then
\[
(A_*x,y_*)= \sum_{p=1}^{q=N}\,
a_{pq}x_q\overline{y_p}
\]
Since the matrix is Hermitian  one sees thst
(i) is equal ton $(x,A_*y)$.
So the densely defined operator $A_*$ is symmetric.
Next, consider its graph
\[
\Gamma(A_*)= \{(x,A_*x)\,\colon\, x\in \ell^2_*\}
\]
and  take its closure in
the product space $\ell^2\times \ell^2$.
This closure is graphic, i.e. there exists
a linesr operstor
$\overline{A_*}$
such that
\[
\overline{\Gamma(A_*)}=
\Gamma(\overline{A_*})
\]
The easy verification is left to the reader.
So here
$\overline{A_*}$ is another densely defined operator and
agsin we leave the esy verificstion thst it is symmetric, i.e.
\[ 
\overline{A_*}x,y)=(x,\overline{A_*}y)
\]
hold for every pair $x,y$ in
$\mathcal D(\overline{A_*})$.
We shall also need a description
$\mathcal D(A)$.
Namely, let $y\in \ell^2$ and suppose there exists
a constsnt $C$ such thst
\[
|(Ax,y)|\leq C||x||\quad\colon\, x\in\ell^2_*
\]
It means thst
$x\mapsto (Ax,y)$ is a bounded linesr functionsl on
$\ell^2_*$ which by density extends  to
a boundd linesr funvionsl on
$\ell^2$. Now this Hilbert space ios self-dusl and hence there
exists a uniwue vector $\xi$ such thst
\[
(x,\xi)= (Ax,y)\quad\colon\quad x\in \ell^2_*
\]
Applied to the case when
$x$ run over the basis vctors one chscks thst
$\xi=Ay$ and that (x) gives a
\emph{necessary and sufficient} confition in order that
$y$ belong to $\mathcal D(A)$.
\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}Show also thst
$A$ is closed, i.e. its graph $\Gamma(A)$ is
closed in $\ell^2\times\ell^2$.
\medskip

\noindent
Since we have the trivisl inclsuion
$\gamma(A_*)\subset \Gamma(A)$ it followd from
the exercise that
$A$ is abn extension of $\overline{A_*}$, i.e. one has
the inclsuuon
\[
\Gamma(\overline{}A_*)\subset \Gamma(A)
\]
At this stage we estsblish a crucial result.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}\emph{The equality (*) holds if and only if
the null spaces of $iE+A$ and $iE-A$ are both zero.}
\medskip


\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Suppose first that (*) holds. If
for example $iE-A$ has a non-trivsl nullspace we find
$0\neq x$ and
\[
ix=Ax\implies i\cdot (Ax,x)= (x,Ax)= (x,ix)=-i(x,x)
\]
which gives a contradiction.
In the same way one checks thst
$iE+A$ has a trivial null-space.
Conversely, assume that
both $iE+A$ snd $iE-A$ have trivial null-spaces.
Now we prove thst this gives
the equality
\[
\Gamma(\overline{}A_*)=\Gamma(A)
\]
Namely, if the inclsuion from (xx)nis strict
we find a vector $y\in\mathcal D(A)$ such that
$(y,Ay)$ is $\perp$ to
the closed graph of
$\overline{A_*}$. In particular
\[
(x,y)+(Ax,Ay)=0\quad\colon\forall\, x\in \ell^2_*
\]
Now (i) implies that
\[
|(Ax,Ay)|\leq ||y||\cdot |x||
\]
so by the criterion in
xxx we condlude thst
$Ay$ belongs to
$\mathcal D(A)$ and (xx) gives
\[
(x,y)+(x,A^2y)=0\quad\colon\forall\, x\in \ell^2_*
\]
Since $\ell^2_*$ is dense in
$\ell^2$ thid entails thst
$y+A^2y=$ which  means that
\[
(E+iA)\cdot(A-iA)(y)=0
\]
But then thr nullspace of
$E+iA$ or $E-iA$ must be non.-trivial
whivh finishes the proof of Theorem xx.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Conclusion.}}
We have alreay seen thst
$\overline{A_*}$ is symmetric. when its graph is equal to
$\Gamma(A)$ it follows that
$A$ also is symmetric, i.e.
\[
(Ax,y)= (x,Ay)\quad\colon x,y\in\mathcal D(A)
\]
Moreover, when (xx) holds it follows exactly as in
(xx) that  the null-spaces of $E+iA$ snd $E-iA$ are both trivial.
\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{A surjectivity theorem.}}
Consider as aobe a Hermitisn mstrix which
gives the densely defined and symmetric operator $\overline{A_*}$.
Here we do not assume that the null-spaces of 
$E+iA$ and $iE-A$ both are trivisl.
However, it turns out the range of
$iE+\overline{A_*}$ and of 
$iE-\overline{A_*}$ both are equal to $\ell^2$.
In fat, more generslly we consider an inhomogrnoueus equstion
\[
\overline{A_*}x=\lambda\cdot \overline{A_*}+y
\]
where $y$ is a vector in
$\ell^2$ and $\lambda$ is a complex number eith
non-zxero imsginsry part,.
 We shall prove thst
(xx) has at leat one solution $x$
whose norm satisfies
\[
||x||\leq \frac{1}{\mathfrak{Im}\lambda}\cdot ||y||
\]
\medskip

DO IT !!!
\medskip

\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{The normal resolvent operators.}}
Now we assume that
$A$ is self-adjoint.
From (xx) it follows that
the operstopr
\[
x\mapsto ix-Ax
\]
its inverse operstor is bounded eith
whose  operstor norm is $\leq 1$.
Put
\[
R=(iE-A)^{-1}
\]
As exposed in ¤ xx it means thst
$R$ is a resolvent  in the sense of Neumann
attwched to the resolvent vslue $i$ of the densely defined
operstor $A$.
In the same way we find thr bounded operstor
\[
S= (iE+A)^{-1}
\]
Next, thr bnounded operstor $R$ has an adjoint $R^*$ snd we shall
prove the equslity
\[
R^*=S
\]
To attain this we consider a pair
of vectors $x,y$ in $\ell^2_*$.
Now
\[
iR(x)+A\circ R(x)=x\implies
\]
\[
(x,y)= i(Rx,y)+(A\circ Rx,y)=i(x,R^*y)+(Rx,Ay)=
-(x,i\cdot R^*y)+(Rx,R^Ay)
\]
Since this hold for every
$x\in \ell^*2_*$ it follows that
\[
y=-iR(y)+R\cdot A(y)
\]
and here $y\in \ell^2_*$ is arbitrary which proves that
$R^*=S$.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Conclusion.}}
Recal,l from Neumann's calculus in ¤ xx thst
reovents of an rbitasry densely defined  oopertor commute.
Applied to the two resovlents $R$ snd $S$
it follows in partioculsr that
$R$ commutes eith its adjoint, i.e. $R$ is a normal operator.
Stsrting from this
the spectral resolution of the self-adjoint operator follows via
Hilbert's  spectral theorem for bounded normal operator in  ¤ xx.



\newpage
















The proof rewuires some preliminary obervations.
Denote by $\ell^2_*$ the subspace of $\ell^2$ whose vectors
are fiunite ${\bf{C}}$-linesr combintiond of
the $e$-vectors.
The given matrix now defines a linesr operstor
$A_*$ whose domain of definition is $\ell^2_*$.
If $x$ and $y$ is a pair of vectors in
$\ell^2_*$ we find an integer $N$ so thst
both belong to the subspace genersted by $e-1,\ldots,e_N$ snd thrn
\[
(A_*x,y_*)= \sum_{p=1}^{q=N}\,
a_{pq}x_q\overline{y_p}
\]
Since the matrix is Hermitian  one sees thst
(i) is equal ton $(x,A_*y)$.
So the densely defined operator $A_*$ is symmetric.
Next, we can consider its graph
\[
\Gamma(A_*)= \{(x,A_*x)\,\colon\, x\in \ell^2_*\}
\]
and then take its closure in
the product space $\ell^2\times \ell^2$.
This closure is grsphic, i.e. there exists
a linesr operstor
$\overline{A_*}$
such that
\[
\overline{\Gamma(A_*)}=
\Gamma(\overline{A_*})
\]
The easy verification is left to the reader.
So here
$\overline{A_*}$ is another densely defined operator and
agsin we leave the esy verificstion thst it is symmetric, i.e.
\[ 
\overline{A_*}x,y)=(x,\overline{A_*}y)
\]
hold for every pair $x,y$ in
$\mathcal D(\overline{A_*})$.

Let $\rho$ be a probsbliity measure on the real $t$-line.
We assume that
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, t^{2k}\,d\rho(t)<\infty
\]
hold for every positive integer $k$.
Then ther exists thr monents
\[
c_\nu=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, t^\nu\,d\rho(t)
\] 
for each non-negative integer $\nu$.
The sequence $\{c_\nu\}$ is not arbitrary because
$\rho$ is a probability measure.
Indeed, let $x_0,x_1,\ldots x_M$ be a  a finite sequence of real numbers.
Then
\[
\sum\, c_{p+q}x_px_q=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\,(\sum\, x_\nu t^\nu)^2\, d\rho(t)
\]
and the last term is $>0$. It can be expressed by the positive Hankel determinants (page 207).
Conversely, start with a positive Hankel sequence $\{c_p\}$.
Now there exists the formal expansion
into continued fractions:
\[
-[\frac{1}{\mu}+\frac{c_1}{\mu^2}+\frac{c_2}{\mu^3}+\ldots]= xxx(page 207)
\]
where (*) entials that eqch $\beta$-number is $>0$.
set $b_\nu= \sqrt{\beta_\nu}$. We obtin the symmetric and infinite matrix
\[
A=***
\]
We are gonig to prove
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}
\emph{For every positive Hankel sequence $\mathcal C=\{c_p\}$
there exists at least one probability measure $\rho$
such that  
$\mathcal C$ gives the sequnce of $\rho$-moments.}
\medskip

\noindent
Keeping $\mathcal C$ fixed we denote by $\Pi(\mathcal C)$
the family of all probability  measures
$\rho$ for whose moments are given by
$\mathcal C$. 
With these nottions the following criterion for uniqueness holds.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}
\emph{The followinig are equivalent for
a positive Hankel sequence: 
A: The famliyl $\Pi(\mathcal C)$ is reduced to a single probability measure. B:
The symmetric matrix $A$ is of Class I.}
\medskip

\noindent
To prove this we will use the truncated $n\times n$-matrices
\[
A_n=****
\]
Let $\mu$ be a complex number in the upper half-plane.
The symmetry of $A_n$ gives a unique ciomplex $n$-vector
$\xi(\mu)$ such that
\[
A_n(\xi(\mu))=\mu\cdot \xi(\mu)+f_1
\]
Set
\[ 
phi_n(\mu)= \xi_1(\mu)
\]
Caremer's rule gives
\[
\phi_n(\mu)=\frac{1}{\det(\mu E_n-A_n)}\cdot P_n(\mu)
\]
where $P_n(\mu)$ is a polynomial of dgeree $n-1$.
Moreover, by simply inspecting the solution of (*) one finds that
\[
\phi_n(\mu)= \mathfrak{c}_n
\]
where the right hand side is the continued fraction up to order $n$.
Moreover, there exists a probability measure $\rho_n$ such that
\[
\phi_n(\mu)= \int\, \frac{d\rho_n(t)}{t-\mu}
\]
and we have also the standard inequality
\[
|\phi_n(\mu)|\leq \frac{1}{\mathfrak{Im}\mu}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Now (xx) entials that
$\{\phi_n(\mu)\}$ is a normal family of analytic functions in
the upper half-plane.
So by Montel's theorem we can
find convergent subsequences.
Consider one such limit function
\[
\phi_*(\mu)=\lim\,
\phi_{n_j}(\mu)
\]
By weak star compactness of probability
measures it follows that we also have
\[
\phi_*(\mu) =\int\, \frac{d\rho_*(t)}{t-\mu}
\]
where $\rho_*$ is a probability measure.
It turns out that one has the inclusion
\[
\rho_*\in \Pi(\mathcal C)
\]
for every limit measure as above.
To prove this we shall perform another construction.
\medskip
 
\noindent
{\bf{The $\psi$-polynomials.}}
Consider the infinite 
$A$-matrix $A$. When $\mu$ is given in the upper half-plane we find
 a unique infinite vector $\gamma$ such that
 \[
 A(\gamma)= \mu\cdot \gamma
 \]
 Rgearding tghe exlitiy eqautions we see that
 \[
 \gamma_n(\mu)=\psi_n(\mu)\cdot \gamma_1(\mu)
 \] 
 hold for each $n|geq 2$ where
 $\psi_n(\mu)$ is a polynomial of degree $n-1$.

\noindent
{\bf{Introduction.}}
The material is foremost  is devoted to 
spectral properties of second order elliptic PDE-operators.
To illustrate the
methods we are content to treat   a special case while 
elliptic operators with variable coefficients 
are  treated in separate notes
devoted to mathematics by 
Carleman.
However,  ¤ E in the appendix  contains
a construction of fundamental solutions
to elliptic
second order operators in
${\bf{R}}^3$ based upon  Carleman's lectures
 at Institute Mittag Leffler in 1935
which might be of interest to some readers even though it will
not be covered during my lecture.
As background  the  appendix  contains a section
which explains
Gustav Neumann's fundamental 
construction from 1879
of resolvents to densely defined 
linear operators,  and at the end of ¤ A we also
recall
Hilbert's spectral theorem for bounded
normal operators on Hilbert spaces.
\medskip


\noindent
Let us now announce a major result which will
be exposed in the lecture.
In
${\bf{R}}^2$ we 
consider a bounded Dirichlet regular domain
$\Omega$, i.e. every $f\in C^0(\partial\Omega)$
has a harmonic extension to $\Omega$.
A wellknown  
fact
established by
G. Neumann and H. Poincar
during the years 1879-1895
gives the following: First there
exists the Greens' function
\[
G(p,q)= \log\,\frac{1}{|p-q|}+H(p,q)
\]
where $H(p,q)= H(q,p)$ is continuous in
the product set
$\overline{\Omega}\times\overline{\Omega}$ with the property that
the operator $\mathcal G$ defined on $L^2(\Omega)$ by
\[
f\mapsto \mathcal G_f(p)= \frac{1}{2\pi}\dot \iint\, G(p,q)f(q)\,dq
\]
satisfies
\[ 
\Delta\circ \mathcal G_f=-f\quad\colon f\in L^2(\Omega)
\]
Moreover,  $\mathcal G$ is a compact operator on
the Hilbert space $L^2(\Omega)$ and there 
exists a sequence $\{f_n\}$ in $L^2(\Omega$ such that
$\{\phi_n=\mathcal G_{f_n}\}$
is an orthonormal basis in $L^2(\Omega$ and
\[ 
\Delta(\phi_n)=-\lambda_n\cdot \phi_n\quad\colon\, n=1,2,\ldots
\] 
where
$0<\lambda_1\leq \lambda_2\leq \ldots\}$.
When  eigenspaces have  dimension $\geq 2$, the 
eigenvalues are repeated by their multiplicity.
The result below  was presented by Carleman at the
Scandinavian Congress in mathematics held in Stockholm 1934:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{0. Theorem. }}\emph{For every Dirichlet regular domain
$\Omega$ and each $p\in\Omega$Êone has the limit formula}
\[ 
\lim_{N\to\infty}\, \lambda_N^{-1}\cdot \sum_{n=1}^{n=N}\, \phi_n(p)^2= \frac{1}{4\pi}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
The strategy in the proof is to consider the function of a complex variable $s$
defined by
\[
\Phi(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\phi_n(p)^2}{\lambda_n^s}
\]
and show that it
is a meromorophic function in the whole complex $s$-plane with
a simple pole at $s=1$ whose residue is $\frac{1}{4\pi}$.
For the reader's convenience we insert  details of the proof in
¤ D of the appendix which 
illustrates the "spirit" of the lecture.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Self-adjoint extensions of $\Delta+c(p)$.}}
Here we consider ${\bf{R}}^3$ with points $p=(x,y,z)$
and $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator, 
while $c(p)$ is a real-valued and locally square integrable function.
The linear operator
\[
u\mapsto L(u)= \Delta(u)+ c\cdot u
\]
is defined on test-functions and hence densely defined on the Hilbert space
$L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$.
In the monograph 
\emph{Sur les quations singulires
 noyaux rel et
symmetrique} [Uppsala University 1923],
Carleman established
spectral resolutions for unbounded
self-adjoint
operators on a Hilbert space together with  conditions 
that densely defined symmetric operators have self-adjoint extensions,
The lecture will 
describe the  major steps of a result due to
 Carleman  which asserts that
the operator $L$ has a self-adjoint extension under the condition that
\[
 \limsup_{p\to \infty}\, c(p)\leq M\tag{*}
 \] 
hold for some constant $M$.
A special  case occurs when
$c(p)$ is a Newtonian potential
\[
c(p)= \sum\, \frac{\alpha_\nu}{|p-q_\nu|}+\beta\tag{**}
\] 
where
$\{q_\nu\}$
is a finite set of points in
${\bf{R}}^2$ while $\{\alpha_\nu\}$ and $\beta$ are positive real numbers.
So here one encounters the Bohr-Schrdinger equation which
stems from quantum mechanics.
With $c$ as in (**)
the requested self-adjoint extension is  
easily verified while the existence of a self-adjoint extension
when (*) holds requires a rather involved proof.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{An asymptotic expansion.}}
Consider the Schrdinger equation
\[
i\cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}= \Delta(u)+ c\cdot u
\]
where we assume
that
$L^\Delta+c$ has a 
self-adjoint extension.
One seeks solutions $u(x,t)$ defined when
$t\geq 0$ and $x\in{\bf{R}}^3$
with an initial  condition $u(x,0)= f(x)$ for some
$f\in L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$.
The solution is given  via the spectral function associated
with
the $L$-operator. 
So the main issue is to
get formulas for the spectral function of $\Delta +c$.
In Carleman's  cited lecture from 1934 
an  asymptotic expansion is given for this spectral function
which merits further study since
one nowadays can
investigate approximative solutions numerically by computers.

\centerline{\bf{¤ A. Linear operators and spectral theory.}}

\bigskip




\noindent
Let $X$ be a Banach space and
$T\colon X\to X$
a linear and densely defined operator whose 
domain of definition 
is  denoted by $\mathcal D(T)$.
In general $T$ is unbounded:
\[
\max_{x\in \mathcal D(T)}\, ||T(x)||=+\infty
\]
where the maximum is taken over
unit vectors in
$\mathcal D(T)$.
The graph is defined by
\[ 
\Gamma(T)=\{ (x,Tx)\,\colon x\in  \mathcal D(T)
\]
If $\Gamma(T)$ is closed in $X\times X$ one says that
$T$ has a closed graph.


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.1 Invertible  operators.}}
A densely defined operator $T$ has a bounded inverse
if the range $T(\mathcal D(T))$ is equal to $X$
and there
exists a positive constant $c$ such that
\[
||T(x)||\geq c\cdot ||x||\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{i}
\]
Since
$T(\mathcal D(T))=X$, (i) gives
for each
$x\in X$ a unique vector $R(x)\in\mathcal D(T)$
such that
\[
T\circ R(x)= x\tag{ii}
\]
Moreover, the inequality (i) gives
\[
||R(x)||\leq c^{-1}\cdot ||x||\quad\colon x\in X\tag{iii}
\]
and when  $R$ is applied to the left on both sides in (ii), it follows that
\[ 
R\circ T(x)=x\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{iv}
\]


\noindent{\bf{A.2 The spectrum $\sigma(T)$}}.
Let
$E$ be the identity operator on $X$. Each complex number
$\lambda$ gives  the densely defined
operator $\lambda\cdot E-T$.
If it fails to be invertible one   says that
$\lambda$ is a spectral  point of $T$ and denote this set
by
$\sigma(T)$.
If $\lambda\in{\bf{C}}\setminus \sigma(T)$
the  inverse  to
$\lambda\cdot E-T$ is denoted by $R_T(\lambda)$
and called a Neumann resolvent to $T$.
By the construction in (A.1)
the range of every Neumann resolvent 
is equal to $\mathcal D(T)$
and one has the  equation:
\[
T\circ R_T(\lambda)(x)= 
R_T(\lambda)\circ T (x)\quad\colon x\in \mathcal D(T)\tag{A.2.1}
\]



\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.3 Neumann's equation.}}
\emph{Assume that
$\sigma(T)$Êis not the whole complex plane.
For each pair 
$\lambda\neq\mu$   outside $\sigma(T)$ the operators 
$R_T(\lambda)$ and $R_T(\mu)$ commute
and}
\[
R_T(\mu)R_T(\lambda)=\frac{R_T(\mu)-R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}\tag{*}
\]


\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Notice that
\[
(\mu\cdot E-T)\cdot \frac{R_T(\mu)-R_T(\lambda)} {\lambda-\mu}
=
\]
\[
\frac{E}{\lambda-\mu}-(\mu-\lambda)\cdot\frac{R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}-
(\lambda\cdot E-T)\cdot \frac{R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}=R_T(\lambda)\tag{i}
\]
Multiplying to the left by
$R_T(\mu)$
gives (*) which  at the same time this shows 
that the resolvent operators commute.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.4 The position of $\sigma(T)$.}}
Assume that ${\bf{C}}\setminus \sigma(T)$ is non-empty.
We can  write (*) in the form
\[
R_T(\lambda)(E+(\lambda-\mu)R_T(\mu))= R_T(\mu)\tag{1}
\]
Keeping $\mu$ fixed we conclude that
$R_T(\lambda)$ exists if and only if
$E+(\lambda-\mu)R_T(\mu))$ is invertible
which implies that
\[
 \sigma(T)= \{\lambda\,\colon \frac{1}{\mu-\lambda}\in
\sigma(R_T(\mu))\} \tag{A.4.1}
 \]

 
 \noindent
Hence one  recovers $\sigma(T)$ via the spectrum of
any given  resolvent operator. Notice that (A.4.1) holds  even
when
the open component
of $\sigma(T)$ has several connected components.


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.4.2 Example.}}
Suppose that $\mu=i$ and that 
$\sigma(R_T(i))$ is contained in a circle
$\{|\lambda+i/2|=1/2\}$.
If $\lambda\in\sigma(T)$ the inclusion (A.4.1) gives some
$0\leq\theta\leq 2\pi$ such that 
\[
\frac{1}{i-\lambda}=-i/2+ 1/2\cdot e^{i\theta}\implies

{\bf{A.4.3 Neumann series.}}
Let     $\lambda_0$  be outside $\sigma(T)$  and
construct the operator valued series
\[
S(\zeta)= R_T(\lambda_0)+ \sum_{n=1}^\infty
(-1)^n\cdot \zeta^n\cdot R_T(\lambda_0)^{n+1}\tag{1}
\]
It is clear that (1)
converges in the Banach space of bounded linear operators when
\[
|\zeta|<\frac{1}{||R_T(\lambda_0)||}\tag{2}
\]
Moreover,  the series expansion (1) gives
\[ 
(\lambda_0+\zeta-T)\cdot S(\zeta)=
(\lambda_0-T)\cdot S(\zeta)+\zeta S(\zeta)=E\tag{3}
\]
Hence
$S(\zeta)=R_T(\lambda_0+\zeta)$ and 
the  locally defined
series in (1) entail the complement of $\sigma(T)$ is open
where $\lambda\mapsto R_T(\lambda)$ is an 
analytic operator-valued  function.
Finally  (*)
in (A.3) and a passage to the limit
as $\mu\to\lambda$ shows that  this analytic function
satisfies the differential equation
\[
\frac{d}{d\lambda}(R_T(\lambda)=-R^2_T(\lambda)\tag{**}

\centerline {\bf{B. Bounded normal operators on Hilbert spaces.}}

\medskip

\noindent
The result below stems from Hilbert's work on integral equations from 1904.
Let $\mathcal H$  be a complex Hilbert space. The  inner product
of a pair of vectors $x,y$ is denoted by
$(x,y)$ and we recall that
\[
(y,x)=\overline{(x,y)}
\]
If $T$ is a bounded 
linear operator  on $\mathcal H$ its adjoint $T^*$ 
satisfies
$(Tx,y)= (x,T^*y)$.
A bounded linear operator $R$ is normal if it commutes with
its adjoint, i.e. if $RR^*=R^*R$.
\medskip

\noindent
 {\bf{B.1 The spectral measure of normal operators.}}
Let $R$ be bounded and normal. Now 
$\sigma(R)$Êis a compact set in the complex plane and
denote by $\mathfrak{M}$ 
the family of all Riesz measures supported by $\sigma(R)$.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}
\emph{There exists a map from
$\mathcal  H\times\mathcal H$ to $\mathfrak{M}$
which to each pair of vectors $x,y$ assigns
$\mu_{\{x,y\}}$ in $\mathfrak{M}$ such that  the following hold for
every pair of non-negative integers}
\[ 
(R^mx,R^ky)= 
\int\, \lambda^m\cdot \bar\lambda^k\cdot 
d\mu_{\{x,y\}}(\lambda)\tag{*}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
If 
$\phi$ is a  bounded Borel function on
$\sigma(R)$ it can be integrated in the sense of Stieltjes
with respect to
the Riesz measures
$\{d\mu_{\{x,y\}}$ which yields
a bounded linear operator
$\widehat{\phi}$ such that
\[
(\widehat{\phi}(x),y)=
\int\, \phi(\lambda)\cdot 
d\mu_{\{x,y\}}(\lambda)\tag{**}
\]
hold for every pair $x,y$ in $\mathcal H$. 
Moreover, (**) in an isometry which means that
the operator norm
$\widehat{\phi}$ 
is the maximum norm of
$|\phi|$ and the spectrum of
the bounded operator
$\widehat{\phi}$ is the closure of the range
$\phi(\sigma(R))$.
It means that
$\phi\mapsto \widehat{\phi}$ is an isomorphism of the 
commutative Banach algebra of bounded Borel functions on
$\sigma(R)$ and a commutative and
closed subalgebra of $L(\mathcal H)$.
In particular every Borel set $e\subset \sigma(R)$ yields
the operator
$\widehat{\chi_e}$ which is an idempotent and
has a spectrum contained in the compact closure of  
the Borel set $e$.

\centerline {\bf{C. Symmetric operators.}}


\medskip

\noindent
A densely defined linear operator $S$ on  a Hilbert space is symmetric if
\[
(Sx,y)= (x,Sy)\,\colon x,y\in\mathcal D(S)
\]
Now there exists the subspace $\mathcal D^*$ of vectors $y$ for which
there exists a constant $C(y)$ such that
\[
|(Sx,y)|\leq C(y)\cdot ||x||\,\colon x\in\mathcal D(S)
\]
Since Hilbert spaces are self-dual and
$\mathcal D(S)$
is dense,
each
$y\in\mathcal D^*$ gives a unique
vector $S^*y$ such that
\[
(Sx,y)= (x,S^*y)\,\colon x\in\mathcal D(S)
\]
So  $S^*$ is a new linear operator where
$\mathcal D(S^*)= \mathcal D^*$.
The symmetry of $S$ entails  that
\[
\Gamma(S)\subset \Gamma(S^*)
\]
One shows easily that $S^*$ has a closed graph and hence
\[
\overline{\Gamma(S)}\subset \Gamma(S^*)\tag{i}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Definition.}}\emph{
A densely defined and symmetric operator S is of type I
if equality holds in (i).}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}} Let $S$ be symmetric and suppose in addition that it has a closed graph.
Show that $S$ is of type I if and only if the two eigenvalue equations
\[
 Sx=i\cdot x\,\colon Sx=-i\cdot x
\]
 have no non-zero solutions.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The Cayley transform.}}
Let $S$ be symmetric
of Type 1.
Using the exercise above one shows that
there exists Neumann's resolvent
\[
 R=R_S(i)=(iE-S)^{-1}
\]
The  equality $S=S^*$
entails that 
$R$Êis a normal operator and 
we can apply  Hilbert's spectral theorem  to $R$. This
gives
a spectral measure of 
$S$-operator.
More precisely, there exists  map
from $\mathcal H\times\mathcal H$ into the space
of complex-valued Riesz measure on the real line. Here
the total variations satisfy
\[
||\mu_{x,y}||=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\,  
|d\mu_{\{x,y\}}(s)|\leq ||x||\cdot ||y||
\]
Moreover, 
$\mu_{\{x,x\}}$ are non-negative
measures for each $x\in\mathcal H$ and 
a vector $x$ belongs to
$\mathcal D(S)$ if and only if
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, s^2\cdot d\mu_{\{x,x\}}(s)<\infty
\]
Finally  one has the equations
\[
(Sx,Sy)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, s^2\cdot d\mu_{\{x,y\}}(s)
\quad\colon\, x,y\in\mathcal H
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
In many applications $S$ is a PDE-operator defined on
a suitable family
of square integrable functions in a domain
$\Omega$ of $ {\bf{R}}^n$ for some
positive integer $n$.
To determine if $S$  is symmetric is  an easy task 
since it suffices to consider its restriction
to the dense subspace of test-functions in
$\Omega$. But to verify that  a  symmetric PDE-operator is of Type I
can be quite involved, and when
$S$ if of  Type I  there remains
to
investigate
the normal operator
$R_S(i)$ above and proceed to determine the spectral measure of $S$ 
expressed
by the $\mu$-map above.
For a quite extensive family of elliptic operators
the spectrum of $S$ discrete and 
one is led to analyze its asymptotic
behaviour. In such studies the symmetry condition can often be relaxed, i.e.
it suffices that the leading part of the PDe-operator is symmetric,
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Example.}}
Let $n=3$ and consider a PDE-operator
\[
L=
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\sum_{q=1}^{q=3}\, a_{pq}(x)\cdot \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_p\partial x_q}+
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\, a_p(x)
\frac{\partial }{\partial x_p}+a_0(x)
\]
The $a$-functions are real-valued and
defined in a neighborhood of the closure of a bounded
domain
$\Omega$ with a $C^1$-boundary.
Here one has the symmetry $a_{pq}=a_{qp}$, and 
$\{a_{pq}\}$ are
of class $C^2$, $\{a_p\}$  of class $C^1$ and $a_0$ is continuous.
The elliptic property of
 $L$ means that
for
every $x\in\Omega$ the eigenvalues of the symmetric
matrix
$A(x)$ with elements $\{a_{pq}(x)\}$
are positive.
Under these conditions, a  result which goes back to work by 
Neumann and Poincar,
gives
a positive constant
$\kappa_0$ such that
if $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$ then
the inhomogeneous equation
\[
L(u)-\kappa^2\cdot u=f\quad\colon f\in L^2(\Omega)
\]
has a unique solution $u$ which is a $C^2$.-function 
in
$\Omega$ and  extends to the closure where it is zero on
$\partial\Omega$.
Moreover, there exists some $\kappa_0$
and for each $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$ a
Green's function
$G(x,y;\kappa)$ such that
\[
(L-\kappa^2)(\frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot \int_\Omega\, 
G(x,y;\kappa)\, f(y)\, dy )= -f(x)\quad\colon f\in L^2(\Omega)\tag{i}
\]
This  means  that the bounded linear operator on
$L^2(\Omega$ defined by
\[
f\mapsto 
-\frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot \int_\Omega\, 
G(x,y;\kappa)\, f(y)\, dy\tag{ii}
\]
is Neumann's resolvent
to the densely defined operator
$L-\kappa^2$ on the 
Hilbert space $L^2(\Omega)$.
After a detailed study of these $G$-functions, Carleman established
an asymptotic formula for
the discrete sequence of eigenvalues $\{\lambda_n\}$. In general they
are complex but arranged so that
the absolute values increase. To begin with one proves rather easily that they
are "almost real" in the sense that there exist positive constants
$C$ and $c$ such that
\[
|\mathfrak{Im}(\lambda_n)|\leq
C\cdot(\mathfrak{Re}(\lambda_n)+c)
\] 
hold for every $n$.
Next, the elliptic
hypothesis means that
the determinant function
\[
D(x)=\det(a_{p,q}(x))
\]
is positive in $\Omega$. With these notations one has

\medskip



\noindent
{\bf{ Theorem.}}
\emph{The following limit formula holds:}
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\, \frac{\mathfrak{Re}(\lambda_n)}{n^{\frac{2}{3}}}
=\frac{1}{6\pi^2}\cdot \int_\Omega\, 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{D(x)}}\, dx\tag{*}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
The formula above is due to Courant and Weyl  when
$P$ is symmetric and was extended to
non-symmetric operators during 
Carleman 's lectures at Institute Mittag-Leffler in  1935.
Weyl and Courant used calculus of variation
in the symmetric case 
while Carleman employed  different methods which
have the merit that the passage to the non-symmetric case
does not cause any  trouble. 
As pointed out by
Carleman the methods in the  proof  
give similar asymptotic formulas 
in   other boundary value problems such as
those considered by Neumann where one imposes boundary value conditions on
outer normals, and so on.
A crucial step during the  proof of the theorem above
is to
construct a fundamental solution $\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$
to the PDE-operators
$L-\kappa^2$ which is exposed in ¤ E.


\newpage


\centerline{\bf{¤ D. Proof of Theorem 0.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
Let
$\Omega$ be a bounded and Dirichlet regular domain.
Let $p\in\Omega$
be kept fixed
and consider the continuous function on
$\partial\Omega$ defined by
\[ 
q\mapsto  \log \frac{1}{|p-q|}
\]
We find the harmonic function
$u_p(q)$ in $\Omega$ such that
$u_p(q)=\log \frac{1}{|p-q|}\,\colon\, q\in\partial\Omega$.
Green's function is defined for pairs $p\neq q$ in
$\Omega\times\Omega$ 
by
\[ 
G(p,q)= \log\,\frac{1}{|p-q|}-u_p(q)\tag{1}
\]
Keeping
if $p\in\Omega$  fixed, the function
$q\mapsto G(p,q)$ extends to the 
closure of $\Omega$ where it vanishes if
$q\in\partial\Omega$.
If  $f\in L^2(\Omega$
we set
\[ 
\mathcal G_f(p)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \int_\Omega\, G(p,q)\cdot f(q)\, dq\tag{2}
\]
where $q=(x,y)$ so that $dq=dxdy$ when the double integral is evaluated.
From (1) we see that
\[
 \iint_{\Omega\times \Omega}\, |G(p,q)|^2\, dpdq<\infty
\]
Hence
$\mathcal G$ is of the Hilbert-Schmidt type and
therefore a compact operator on 
$L^2(\Omega)$.
Next,  recall that
$\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \log\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is
a fundamental solution to the Laplace operator.
From this one can deduce the following:

\medskip

\noindent{\bf{D.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{For each $f\in L^2(\Omega)$
the Lapacian of $\mathcal G_f$
taken in the distribution sense belongs to
$L^2(\Omega)$ and one has the equality}
\[ 
\Delta(\mathcal G_f)=-f\tag{*}
\] 
\medskip


\noindent
The equation (*) means that
the composed operator
$\Delta\circ \mathcal G$ is minus the identity on
$L^2(\Omega)$.
We are  led
to introduce the 
linear operator $S$ on $L^2(\Omega)$ 
defined by $\Delta$, where  
$\mathcal D(S)$ is
the range of $\mathcal G$.
If $g\in C^2_0(\Omega)$, i.e. twice differentiable and with
compact support, it follows via Greens' formula that
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \int_\Omega\, G(p,q)\cdot \Delta(g)(q)\, dq=-g(p)
\]
In particular $C_0^2(\Omega)\subset\mathcal D(S)$
which  implies that
$S$ is densely defined and we  leave it to the reader to verify that
\[
\mathcal G(\Delta(f))=-f\quad\colon f\in\mathcal D(S)
\]


\medskip
\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
By the construction of resolvent operators in ¤ 1 this means that
$-\mathcal G$ is Neumann's inverse  of 
$S$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}} Show that $S$ has a closed range and in addition it
is self-adjoint, i.e. $S=S^*$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The spectrum of $S$.}}
A wellknown  result 
asserts that there exists an orthonormal basis $\{\phi_n\}$ in $L^2(\Omega)$
where each $\phi_n\in\mathcal D(S)$ is an eigenfunction. More preciesely
there is a non-decreasing sequence of positive real numbers
$\{\lambda_n\}$ and
\[ 
\Delta(\phi_n)+\lambda_n\cdot \phi_n=0\quad\colon n=1,2,\ldots\tag{i}
\]
Let us remark that (i) means that
\[
\mathcal G(\phi_n)= \frac{1}{\lambda_n}\, \cdot \phi_n\tag{ii}
\]
So above
$\{\lambda_n^{-1}\}$
are  eigenvalues of the compact operator $\mathcal G$ whose sole cluster
point is $\lambda=0$.
Eigenvalues whose eigenspaces have
dimension $e>1$ are repeated $e$ times.



\medskip

\noindent
Now we begin the proof of Theorem 0, i.e. we will  show that
the following hold
for each point $p\in\Omega$:
\[
\lim_{n\to \infty}\, \frac{1}{\lambda_n}\cdot
\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\, \phi_k(p)^2=
 \frac{1}{4\pi}\tag{*}
 \]
 \medskip
 
 
 \noindent
To prove (*) we  consider the Dirichlet series
for each fixed $p\in\Omega$:
\[ 
\Phi_p(s)=\sum _{n=1}^\infty \, \frac{\phi_n(p)^2}{\lambda_n^s}\tag{**}
\]
It is easily seen that
$\Phi_p(s)$ is analytic in a half-space
$\mathfrak{Re} s>b$ for a large $b$.
Less trivial is the following:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{D.2 Theorem.}}
\emph{There exists an entire function
$\Psi_p(s)$ such that}
\[
\Phi_p(s)=\Psi_p(s)+\frac{1}{4\pi(s-1)}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Let us first remark that Theorem D.2  gives (*) via
a result  due to Wiener in the article
\emph{Tauberian theorem} [Annals of Math.1932].
Wiener's theorem 
asserts that if $\{\lambda_n\}$ is a non-decreasing sequence of
positive numbers which tends to infinity and
$\{a_n\}$ are non-negative real numbers such that
there exists the limit
\[ 
\lim_{s\to 1}\,(s-1)\cdot \sum\, \frac{a_n}{\lambda_n^s}=A
\] 
then it follows that
\[
\lim_{n\to \infty}\,\lambda_n^{-1}\cdot
\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\, a_k=A
\]
\medskip

\centerline{\emph{Proof of Theorem D.2}}

\bigskip

\noindent
Since $\mathcal G$ is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator a wellknown result due to Schur
gives
\[
\sum\, \lambda_n^{-2}<\infty \tag{i}
\]
This convergence entails that various constructions below are defined.
For each $\lambda$ outside $\{\lambda_n\}$ we set
\[
G(p,q;\lambda)=
G(p,q)+
2\pi\lambda\cdot \sum_{n=1}^\infty\,
\frac{\phi_n(p)\phi_n(q)}{\lambda_n(\lambda-\lambda_n)}\tag{ii}
\]
This gives the integral operator
$\mathcal G_\lambda$ defined on $L^2(\Omega)$ by
 \[ 
 \mathcal G_\lambda(f)(p)
 =\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \iint_\Omega\, G(p,q;\lambda )\cdot f(q)\, dq\tag{iii}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A. Exercise.}} Use that the eigenfunctions $\{\phi_n\}$ is an orthonormal basis in
$L^2(\Omega)$ to show that
\[
(\Delta+\lambda)\cdot \mathcal G_\lambda=-E
\]


\noindent{\bf{B. The function $F(p,\lambda)$}}.
Set
\[ 
F(p,q,\lambda)= G(p,q;\lambda)- G(p,q)
\]
Keeping $p$ fixed we see that (ii) gives
\[
\lim_{q\to p}\, F(p,q,\lambda)=
2\pi\lambda\cdot \sum_{n=1}^\infty\,
\frac{\phi_n(p)^2}{\lambda_n(\lambda-\lambda_n)}\tag{B.1}
\]
Set
\[
F(p,\lambda)=
\lim_{q\to p}\, F(p,q,\lambda)
\]
From (i) and (B.1) it follows that it is a meromorphic function in
the complex $\lambda$-plane with at most simple poles
at $\{\lambda_n\}$.
\medskip

\noindent{\bf{C. Exercise.}}
Let $0<a<\lambda_1$. Show via residue calculus that
one has the equality below in a half-space
$\mathfrak{Re}\, s>2$:
\[ 
\Phi(s)=
\frac{1}{4\pi^2 \cdot i}\cdot \int_{a-i\infty}^{a+i\infty}\, 
F(p,\lambda)\cdot \lambda^{-s}\, d\lambda\tag{C.1}
\]
where the line integral  is taken on the vertical  line
$\mathfrak{Re}\,\lambda=a$.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{D. Change of contour integrals.}}
At this stage we employ a device which goes to
Riemann and
move the integration into the half-space
$\mathfrak{Re}(\lambda)<a$.
Consider  the curve $\gamma_+$
defined as the union of the
negative real interval $(-\infty,a]$ followed by
the upper
half-circle $\{\lambda= ae^{i\theta}\,\colon 0\leq\theta\leq \pi \}$
and the 
half-line $\{\lambda= a+it\,\colon t\geq 0\}$.
Cauchy's theorem entails that 
\[ 
\int_{\gamma_+}\, F(p,\lambda)\cdot \lambda^{-s}\, d\lambda=0
\]
We leave it to the reader to contruct the
similar
curve
$\gamma_-=\bar \gamma_+$. Using 
the vanishing of these line integrals and taking the branches of the 
multi-valued function
$\lambda^s$ into the account the reader should verify the following:

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{E. Lemma.}}
\emph{One has the equality}
\[ 
\Phi(s)=\frac{a^{s-1}}{4\pi}\cdot \int_{-\pi}^\pi\,
F(ae^{i\theta})\cdot e^{(i(1-s)\theta}\,d\theta
+
\frac{\sin \pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot \int_a^\infty\, F(p,-x)\cdot x^{-s}\,dx\tag{E.1}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
The first term in the sum of the right hand side of (E.1)
is obviously an entire function of $s$. So there remains to
prove that
\[
 s\mapsto  \frac{\sin \pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot \
 \int_a^\infty\, F(p,-x)\cdot x^{-s}\,dx\tag{E.2}
\]
is meromorphic with
a single pole at $s=1$ whose residue is $\frac{1}{4\pi}$.
To attain this we  express $F(p,-x)$ when $x$ are real and positive in another way.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{F.  The $K$-function.}}
In the half-space $\mathfrak{Re}\,z>0$ there exists the analytic function
\[
K(z)= \int_1^\infty\, \frac{e^{-zt}}{\sqrt{t^2-1}}\,dt
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that $K$ extends to a multi-valued analytic function outside
$\{z=0\}$ given by
\[
K(z)=-I_0(z)\cdot \log z+ I_1(z)\tag{F.1}
\] 
where $I_0$ and $I_1$ are entire functions
with series expansions
\[
I_0(z)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty\, \frac{2^{-2m}}{(m!)^2}\cdot
z^{2m}\tag{i}
\]
\[ 
I_1(z)= \sum_{m=0}^\infty\, \rho(m)\cdot
\frac{2^{-2m}} {(m!)^2} \cdot z^{2m}\quad
\colon \rho(m)=1+\frac{1}{2}+\ldots+\frac{1}{m}-\gamma\tag{ii}
\]
where $\gamma$ is the usual Euler constant.

\bigskip


\noindent
With  $p$ kept fixed and $\kappa>0$ 
we solve the Dirichlet problem and find
a  function $q\mapsto H(p,q;\kappa)$ which satisfies  the
equation
\[
 \Delta(H)-\kappa\cdot H=0\tag{F.2}
\] 
in $\Omega$ with boundary values
\[ 
H(p,q;\kappa)=K(\sqrt{\kappa}|p-q|)\quad\colon q\in \partial\Omega
\]


\noindent
{\bf{G. Exercise.}}
Verify the equation
\[ 
G(p,q;-\kappa)=K(\sqrt{\kappa}\cdot |p-q|)- H(q;\kappa)\quad\colon \kappa>0
\]



\noindent
Next,   the construction of $G(p,q)$ gives
\[
 F(p,-\kappa)=
 \lim_{q\to p}\,
 [K(\sqrt{\kappa}\cdot |p-q|)+\log\,|p-q|]+
 \lim_{q\to p}\,[u_p(q)+ H(p,q,\kappa)]\tag{G.1}
\]
The last term above has the  "nice limit" 
$u_p(p)+H(p,p,\kappa)$ and from  (F.1)  the reader can  verify the limit formula:
\[
 \lim_{q\to p}\,
 [K(\sqrt{\kappa}\cdot |p-q|)+\log\,|p-q|]=
 -\frac{1}{2}\cdot \log \kappa +\log 2-\gamma\tag{G.2}
\]
where $\gamma$ is  Euler's constant.

\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{H. Final part of the proof.}}.
Set $A=  +\log 2-\gamma+u_p(p)$. Then (G.1) and (G.2)
give
\[
F(p,-\kappa)= -\frac{1}{2}\cdot \log \kappa +A+H(p,p;-\kappa)
\]
With $x=\kappa$ in (E.2 ) we  proceed  as follows.
To  begin with it is clear that
\[
s\mapsto A\cdot 
\frac{\sin \pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot \int_a^\infty\,  x^{-s}\,dx
\]
is an entire function of $s$.
Next,  consider the function
\[ 
\rho(s)=
 -\frac{1}{2}\cdot 
\frac{\sin \pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot \int_a^\infty\,  \log x\cdot x^{-s}\,dx
\]
Notice that the complex derivative
\[
\frac{d}{ds}\,  \int_a^\infty\,  x^{-s}\,dx=
- \int_a^\infty\,  \log x\cdot x^{-s}\,dx
\]

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf{H.1 Exercise.}}
Use the  above to show that
\[
\rho(s)-\frac{1}{4\pi(s-1)}
 \]
is an entire function.
\medskip


\noindent
From the above we see that Theorem D.2  follows if we have proved
\medskip

\noindent
 {\bf{H.2 Lemma.}}
\emph{The following function  is entire}:
\[
s\mapsto \frac{\sin\,\pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot
\int_a^\infty\, H(p,p,\kappa)\cdot  \kappa^{-s}\,d\kappa
\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
When $\kappa>0$
the equation (F.1) shows that $q\mapsto H(p,q;\kappa)$
is subharmonic  in $\Omega$ and the maximum principle gives
\[
0\leq  H(p,q;\kappa)\leq \max_{q\in\partial\Omega}\,K(\kappa|p-q|)\tag{i}
\]
With  $p\in\Omega$ fixed there is 
a positive number
$\delta$ such that
$|p-q|\geq\delta\,\colon q\in \partial\Omega$ which  
gives
positive constants
$B$ and  $\alpha$  such that
\[
H(p,p;\kappa)\leq e^{-\alpha\kappa}\quad\colon \kappa>0\tag{ii}
\]
The reader may now check that this
exponential decay gives Lemma H.2.

\centerline {\bf{¤ E. Fundamental solutions to second order
Elliptic operators.}}
\bigskip


\noindent
In
${\bf{R}}^3$ with coordinates $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ we consider 
 a second order PDE-operator
\[
L=
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\sum_{q=1}^{q=3}\, a_{pq}(x)\cdot \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_p\partial x_q}+
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\, a_p(x)
\frac{\partial }{\partial x_p}+a_0(x)
\]
where 
$a$-functions are real-valued and
one has the symmetry $a_{pq}=a_{qp}$.
To ensure existence of a globally defined fundamental solutions we
suppose the the following limit formulas hold
as $(x,y,z)\to \infty$:
\[
\lim a_\nu(x,y,z)=0 \colon 0\leq p\leq 3\quad\colon\,
\lim a_{pq}(x,y,z)= \text{Kronecker's delta function}
\]
Thus, $L$ approaches the Laplace operator as $(x,y,z)$ tends to
infinity. Moreover
$L$ is elliptic which means that
the eigenvalues of the symmetric
matrix with elements $\{a_{pq}(x)\}$
are positive for every $x$.
Recall the  notion of  fundamental solutions.
First we consider
the adjoint
operator:
\[ 
L^*(x,\partial _x)=P-2\cdot \bigl(
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\, \bigl(\sum_{q=1}^{q=3}\, 
\frac{\partial a_{pq}}{\partial x_q}\bigr)\cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial x\uuu p}
-\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\, \frac{\partial a_p}{\partial x_p}
+2\cdot \sum\sum\, \frac{\partial^2 a_{pq}}{\partial x_p\partial x_q}\tag{0.1}
\]
Partial integration gives  the equation  below for every pair of
$C^2$-functions $\phi,\psi $ in ${\bf{R}}^3$ with compact support:
\[
\int\, L(\phi)\cdot \psi\, dx=
\int\, \phi\cdot L^*(\psi)\, dx\tag{0.2}
\] 
where
the volume integrals are taken over
${\bf{R}}^3$.
A locally integrable function $\Phi(x)$ in ${\bf{R}}^3$
is  a fundamental solution to $L(x,\partial _x)$
if
\[
\psi(0)=\int\, \Phi\cdot L^*(\psi)\, dx\tag{0.3}
\] 
hold for every $C^2$-function  $\psi$ with compact support.
Next, to each 
positive number
$\kappa$ we  get  the PDE-operator $L-\kappa^2$ and a
function $x\mapsto \Phi(x;\kappa)$ is a fundamental solution to $L-\kappa^2$
if
\[
\psi(0)=\int\, \Phi(x:\kappa)\cdot (L^*-\kappa^2)(\psi(x))\, dx\tag{0.4}
\] 
hold for compactly supported $C^2$-functions $\psi$.
Next, the  origin can  replaced by a variable point $\xi$ in
${\bf{R}}^3$ and then one seeks
a function
$\Phi^*(x,\xi;\kappa)$ with the property that
\[
\psi(\xi)=\int\, \Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)\cdot (L^*(x,\partial_x)-\kappa^2)(\psi(x))\, dx\tag{*}
\] 
hold for all  $\xi\in{\bf{R}}^3$
and every $C^2$-function $\psi$ with compact support.
Keeping $\kappa$ fixed this means that  
$\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ is a function of six variables  defined in 
${\bf{R}}^3\times {\bf{R}}^3$.
Theorem 1.9 below 
gives
sharp estimate for  fundamental
solutions. 
The subsequent constructions 
are 
based upon a
classic formula due to Newton and  specific solutions to
integral equations
found by a convergent Neumann series.

\centerline {\bf{1. The construction of $\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$.}}
\medskip



\noindent
When $L$ has
constant coefficients 
the construction of   fundamental solutions was given by
Newton in his famous
text-books from 1666.
We have the
positive  and symmetric $3\times 3$-matrix
$A= \{a_{pq}\}$. Let
$\{b_{pq}\}$ be the elements of the inverse matrix and 
put
\[
\alpha=\sqrt{\kappa^2+\frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq} a_pa_q
-a_0}
\]
where $\kappa$ is chosen so large that
the term under the square-root is $>0$.
Define the quadratic form
 \[ 
 B(x)= \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq} a_px_q
\]

\noindent
With these notations Newton's fundamental solution taken
at $x=0$ becomes
\[
H(x;\kappa)= \frac{1}{4\pi\cdot \sqrt{\Delta\cdot B(x)}}
\cdot e^{-\alpha \sqrt{B(x)}-
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p,q}b_{pq} a_p\cdot x_q}\tag{1.1} 
\]


\medskip




\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}} Verify by Stokes  formula
that $H(x;\kappa)$ indeed yields  a fundamental solution
to the PDE-operator $L(\partial_x)-\kappa^2$.



\bigskip



\noindent{\emph{1.2 The case with variable coefficients.}}
For each $\xi\in{\bf{R}}^3$ the elements of the inverse matrix
to $\{a_{pq}(\xi)$
are denoted by $\{b_{pq}(\xi)\}$.
Choose $\kappa_0>0$ such that
\[
\kappa_0^2+\frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq}(\xi) a_p(\xi)a_q(\xi)
-b(\xi)>0\quad\text{hold for all}\quad  \xi\in{\bf{R}}^3
\] 
and for every $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$ we set
\[
\alpha_\kappa(\xi)=
\sqrt{\kappa^2+\frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq}(\xi) a_p(\xi)a_q(\xi)
-b(\xi)}\tag{i}
\]
Following Newton's construction in (1.1) we
put:
\[
H(x,\xi;\kappa)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot
 \frac{\sqrt{\Delta(\xi)}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{
\sqrt{ \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq}(\xi)\cdot x_px_q}}
\cdot e^{-\alpha_\kappa(\xi) \sqrt{B(x)}-
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p,q}b_{pq}(\xi) a_p(\xi)\cdot x_q} \tag{ii}
\]

\noindent
When $\xi$ is kept fixed this  function of
$x$ is real analytic  outside the origin and we also notice
that $x\to H(x,\xi;\kappa)$ is locally integrable
as a function of $x$ in a neighborhood of the origin.
We are going to find a fundamental solution
which takes the form
\[
\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)=
H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)+\int_{{\bf{R}}^3}\, 
H(x-y,\xi;\kappa)\cdot\Psi(y,\xi;\kappa)\, dy\tag{iii}
\]
where the $\Psi$-function is the solution to an integral equation
which we construct in (1.5).

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.3 The function $F(x,\xi;\kappa)$.}}
For every fixed $\xi$ we consider the  differential operator in the
$x$-space:
\[ 
L_*(x,\partial_x,\xi;\kappa)=
\]
\[\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\sum_{q=1}^{q=3}\, (a\uuu{pq}(x)-
(a\uuu{pq}(\xi))\cdot 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_p\partial x_q}+
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\,
(a_p(x)-a_p(\xi))\frac{\partial}{\partial x_p}+ (b(x)-b(\xi))
\]

\medskip

\noindent
With $\xi$ fixed we apply $L_*$ to the function
$x\mapsto H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)$
and put
\[ 
F(x,\xi;\kappa)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot L_*(x,\partial_x,\xi;\kappa)(H(x-\xi,\xi,\kappa)) \tag{1.3.1}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.4 Two  estimates.}}
The limit conditions  in (0.0)     give  positive constants
$C,C_1$ and $k$ such that the following hold when $\kappa\geq\kappa_0$:
\[
|H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)|\leq C\cdot \frac{e^{-k\kappa|x-\xi|}}{|x-\xi|}
\quad\colon\,
[F(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq C_1\cdot 
\frac{e^{-k\kappa|x-\xi|}}{|x-\xi|^2}
\tag{1.4.1}
\]


\noindent
The verification of (1.4.1) is left as an exercise.



\bigskip





\noindent
{\bf{1.5 An integral equation.}}
We  seek
$\Psi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ which satisfies the equation:
\[ 
\Psi(x,\xi;\kappa)= \int_{{\bf{R}}^3}\,  F(x,y;\kappa)\cdot \Psi(y,\xi;\kappa)\,dy+F(x,\xi;\kappa)\tag{1.5.1}
\]
To solve (1.5.1 )
we construct the Neumann series of $F$.
Thus, starting with $F^{(1)}=F$ we set
\[
F^{(k)}(x,\xi;\kappa)=\int_{{\bf{R}}^3}\, F(x,y;\kappa)\cdot
F^{(k-1)}(y,\xi;\kappa)\, dy\quad\colon\quad k\geq 2\tag{1.5.2}
\]
Then (1.4.1 ) gives  the inequality
\[
|F^{(2)}(x,\xi;\kappa)|
\leq C_1^2\iiint
\frac{e^{-k\kappa|\xi-y|}}{|x-y|^2\cdot |\xi-y|^2}\cdot dy\tag{i}
\]


\noindent
To estimate (i) we  notice that the triple integral after
the substitution $y-\xi\to u$
becomes
\[
C_1^2\iiint
\frac{e^{-k\kappa|u|^2}}{|x-u-\xi|^2\cdot |u|^2}\cdot du\tag{ii}
\]


\noindent
In  (ii)  the volume integral can be integrated in polar
coordinates
and becomes
\[
C_1^2\cdot \int_0^\infty\int_{S^2}\, 
\frac{e^{-k\kappa r^2}}{|x-r\cdot w-\xi|^2}\cdot dwdr\tag{iii}
\]
where $S^2$ is the unit sphere and $dw$ the area measure on
$S^2$ and we see that (iii) becomes
\[
2\pi C_1^2\cdot
\int_0^\infty\int_0^\pi\, 
\frac{e^{-k\kappa r}}{(x-\xi)^2+r^2-
2r\cdot |x-\xi|\cdot \sin\theta}\cdot d\theta dr=
\]
\[
\frac{2\pi C_1^2}{|x-\xi|}\cdot\int_0^\infty\, e^{-k\kappa |x-\xi|t}\cdot
\log\, |\frac{1+t}{1-t}|\cdot \frac{dt}{t}\tag{iv}
\]
where the last equality follows by a straightforward computation.

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{1.6 Exercise.}}
Show that (iv) gives the estimate
\[
|F^{(2)}(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq \frac{2\pi\cdot  C_1^2\cdot C_1^*}{\kappa\cdot |x-\xi|^2}
\]
where $C_1^*$ is a fixed positive constant
which is independent of $x$ and $\xi$ and 
show by an induction over $n$
that one has:
\[
|F^{(n)}(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq\frac{C_1}{|x-\xi|^2}\cdot 
\bigl[\frac{2\pi C_1^2\cdot C_1^*}{\kappa}\bigr]^{n-1}
\quad\text{hold for every}\quad  n\geq 2\tag{*}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.6 Conclusion.}}
With $\kappa_0^*$ so large that
$2\pi C_1^2\cdot C_1^*<\kappa_0^*$
it follows from (*) that
the Neumann series
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty F^{(n)}(x,\xi;\kappa)
\]
converges when 
$\kappa\geq \kappa_0^*$ 
and
gives the requested solution $\Psi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ in (1.5.1).
\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{1.7 Exercise.}}
Above we  have found 
$\Psi$ which satisfies the integral equation in ¤ 1.5.1
Use  Green's formula to show
that the function
$\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ defined in (1.2.1) gives  a fundamental solution
of $L(x,\partial_x)-\kappa^2$.

\medskip


\noindent{\bf {1.8 A final estimate.}}
The  constructions above show that
the  functions
\[
x\mapsto \Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)\quad\text{and}\quad 
x\mapsto H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)
\]


\noindent
have the same  singularities at $x=\xi$.
Consider the difference
\[
G(x,\xi;\kappa)=\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)-
H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)\tag{1.8.1}
\]
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{1.8.2 Exercise.}}
Use the previous constructions to show
that for every $0<\gamma\leq 2$
there is a constant $C_\gamma$
such that
\[
\bigl |G(x,\xi;\kappa)\,\bigr|\leq \frac{C_\gamma}{(\kappa|x-\xi|)^{\gamma}}
\]
hold for every pair $(x,\xi)$ and every $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$.
Together with the  the inequality for the
$H$-function in (1.4.1)
this gives
an estimate for the fundamental solution $\Phi$.
More precisely we have proved:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.9 Theorem.}} \emph{With $\kappa_0^*$ as above
there exist positive constants $C$ and $k$ and
for each $0<\gamma\leq 2$ a constant $C_\gamma$ such that}
\[
|\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq
C\cdot \frac{e^{-k\kappa|x-\xi|}}{|x-\xi|}+
 \frac{C_\gamma}{(\kappa|x-\xi|)^{\gamma}}
\]
\emph{hold for all pairs $(x,\xi)$ in ${\bf{R}}^3$ and every
$\kappa\geq \kappa_0^*$.}


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
Above $C$ and $k$ are independent of
$\kappa$ as soon as $\kappa_0^*$ has been chosen as above.
The size of these constant  depend on
the $C^2$-norms of the functions $\{a_{pq}(x)\}$ and 
as well as the $C^1$-norms of $\{a_1,a_2,a-3\}$ and the maximum norm of $a_0$.
Notice that the whole construction is "canonical", i.e.
the resulting fundaemtnal ssolutions
$\{\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)\}$ are uniquely determined.
We remark that simiular constructions can be made for
ellptic operators
of even degree $2m$ with $m\geq 2$. Here
Newton's solution for constant  coefficients is replaced by those
 of
Fritz John which arise via the wave deompostion of the Dirac measure.
It would be interesting tanalyze the resulting version of Theorem 1.9.
Of course, one  can also extend
everything to
elliptic operators of $n$ variables were $n\geq 4$
in which case the
denominator $|x-\xi|^{-1}$ is replaced by
$|x-\xi|^{-n+2}$.










\newpage































\newpage



















The proof of Theorem 1 relies upon the
construction
of fundamental  solutions which is given in ¤ 1 below.
After this  has been achieved,
the asymptotic formula (*)  in Theorem 2 is derived
via  Tauberian theorems for Dirichlet
series which  goes as follows:
Let $\{a_\nu\}$ and  $\lambda_\nu\}$ be two sequences
of positive numbers where
$\lambda_\nu\to +\infty$ and  the series
\[ 
f(x)= \sum_{\nu=1}^\infty\, \frac{a_\nu}{\lambda_\nu+x}
\]
converges when $x>x_*$ for some positive number $x_*$.
Next, for every $x>0$ we
define the function
\[
\mathcal A(x)= \sum_{\{\lambda_\nu<x\}}\, a_\nu
\]
In other words, with $x>0$ we find the largest integer $\nu(x)$
such that $\lambda-{\nu(x)}<x$ and
then $\mathcal A(x)$ is the sum over the $a$-numbers up to
this index. With these notations the following implication holds
for every pair 
$A>0 $ andÊ$0<\alpha<1$


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{3.  Theorem.}}
\emph{Suppose there exists a constant $A>0$ and some
$0<\alpha<1$ such that}
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty}\,
x^\alpha\cdot f(x)=A\implies
\lim_{x\to\infty}\, \mathcal A(x)=
\frac{A}{\pi}\cdot \frac{\sin\, \pi\alpha}{1-\alpha}\cdot x^{1-\alpha}
\]

\medskip












\centerline {\bf{0 Preliminary constructions.}}
\medskip


\noindent
We are given an ellipitic operator $L$
as above
and assume that the coefficients are defined in
the whole space
${\bf{R}}^3$.
To ensure convergence of volume integrals  taken over
the whole of ${\bf{R}}^3$
we add the conditions that
\[ 
\lim_{|x|\to \infty}\ a_{pp}(x)= 1\quad\colon\quad 1\leq p\leq 3
\]
while  $\{a_{pq}\}$ for $p\neq q$ and 
$a_1,a_2,a_3,b$ tend to zero as $|x|\to +\infty$.
This  means that $P$ approaches the Laplace operator when
$|x|$ is large.
Let us 
recall the  notion of a fundamental solution 
which prior to the general notion of distributions
introduced by L. Schwartz, 
was referred to as a 
\emph{Grundlsung}.
First,
the regularity  of the
coefficients of a PDE-operator $P$ 
enable us to construct 
the adjoint
operator:
\[ 
P^*(x,\partial _x)=P-2\cdot \bigl(
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\, \bigl(\sum_{q=1}^{q=3}\, 
\frac{\partial a_{pq}}{\partial x_q}\bigr)\cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial x\uuu p}
-\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\, \frac{\partial a_p}{\partial x_p}
+2\cdot \sum\sum\, \frac{\partial^2 a_{pq}}{\partial x_p\partial x_q}
\]
Partial integration gives  the equation  below for every pair of
$C^2$-functions $\phi,\psi $ in ${\bf{R}}^3$ with compact support:
\[
\int\, P(\phi)\cdot \psi\, dx=
\int\, \phi\cdot P^*(\psi)\, dx
\] 
where
the volume integrals are taken over
${\bf{R}}^3$.
A locally integrable function $\Phi(x)$ in ${\bf{R}}^3$
is  a fundamental solution to $P(x,\partial _x)$
if
\[
\psi(0)=\int\, \Phi\cdot P^*(\psi)\, dx
\] 
hold for every $C^2$-function  $\psi$ with compact support.
Next, to each 
positive number
$\kappa$ we  get  the PDE-operator $P-\kappa^2$ and a
function $\Phi(x;\kappa)$ is a fundamental solution to $P-\kappa^2$
if
\[
\psi(0)=\int\, \Phi(x:\kappa)\cdot (P^*-\kappa^2)(\psi(x))\, dx\tag{1}
\] 
hold for compactly supported $C^2$-functions $\psi$.
Above $\kappa$ appears as an index of $\Phi$, i.e. for each fixed
$\kappa$ we have the locally integrable function
$x\mapsto \Phi(x:\kappa)$.
Next, the  origin can  replaced by a variable point $\xi$ in
${\bf{R}}^3$ and then one seeks
a function
$\Phi^*(x,\xi;\kappa)$ with the property that
\[
\psi(\xi)=\int\, \Phi(x,\xi:\kappa)\cdot (P^*-\kappa^2)(\psi(x))\, dx\tag{*}
\] 
hold for all  $\xi\in{\bf{R}}^3$
and every $C^2$-function $\psi$ with compact support.
Keeping $\kappa$ fixed this means that  
$\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ is a function of six variables  defined in 
${\bf{R}}^3\times {\bf{R}}^3$.
Fundamental solutions are in general not unique. However, when
$P$ is an elliptic operator as above
we shall
give an explicit construction of
fundamental solutions
$\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ for all sufficiently large $\kappa$ in ¤ 1.


\bigskip


\centerline {\bf{1. The construction of $\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$.}}
\medskip


\medskip

\noindent
\emph{1.1 The case when $P$ has constant coefficients.}
Here the   fundamental solution is given by a 
formula  which goes back to Newton's work
in his classic text-books from 1666.
We have the
positive  and symmetric $3\times 3$-matrix
$A= \{a_{pq}\}$. Let
$\{b_{pq}\}$ be the elements of the inverse matrix and recall 
that they are found via Cramr's rule:
\[ 
b_{pq}= \frac{A_{pq}}{\Delta}
\]
where $\Delta=\det(A)$ and $\{A_{pq}\}$  are the cofactor
minors of the $A$-matrix. Put
\[
\alpha=\sqrt{\kappa^2+\frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq} a_pa_q
-b}
\]
where $\kappa$ is chosen so large that
the term under the square-root is $>0$.
Next, define the quadratic form
 \[ 
 B(x)= \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq} a_px_q
\]

\noindent
With these notations Newton's fundamental solution taken
at $x=0$ becomes
\[
H(x;\kappa)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Delta\cdot B(x)}}
\cdot e^{-\alpha \sqrt{B(x)}-
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p,q}b_{pq} a_p\cdot x_q}\tag{*} 
\]


\medskip




\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}} Verify by Stokes  formula
that $H(x;\kappa)$ indeed yields  a fundamental solution
to the PDE-operator $P(\partial_x)-\kappa^2$.



\bigskip



\centerline{\emph{1.2 The case with variable coefficients.}}
\medskip


\noindent
Choose $\kappa_0>0$ such that
\[
\kappa_0^2+\frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq}(\xi) a_p(\xi)a_q(\xi)
-b(\xi)>0\quad\text{hold for all}\quad  \xi\in{\bf{R}}^3
\] 
and for every $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$ we set
\[
\alpha_\kappa(\xi)=
\sqrt{\kappa^2+\frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq}(\xi) a_p(\xi)a_q(\xi)
-b(\xi)}\tag{i}
\]
Following Newton's construction for the case of constant
coefficients we put:
\[
H(x,\xi;\kappa)=
 \frac{\sqrt{\Delta(\xi)}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{
\sqrt{ \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq}(\xi)\cdot x_px_q}}
\cdot e^{-\alpha_\kappa(\xi) \sqrt{B(x)}-
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p,q}b_{pq}(\xi) a_p(\xi)\cdot x_q} \tag{ii}
\]





\noindent
When $\xi$ is kept fixed this  function of
$x$ is real analytic  outside the origin and the
singularity at $x=0$
is of Newton's type. In particular
$x\to H(x,\xi;\kappa)$ is locally integrable
as a function of $x$ in a neighborhood of the origin.
Next, for every fixed $\xi$ we consider the  differential operator in the
$x$-space:
\[ 
L_*(x,\partial_x,\xi;\kappa)=
\]
\[\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\sum_{q=1}^{q=3}\, (a\uuu{pq}(x)-
(a\uuu{pq}(\xi))\cdot 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_p\partial x_q}+
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\,
(a_p(x)-a_p(\xi))\frac{\partial}{\partial x_p}+ (b(x)-b(\xi))
\]

\medskip

\noindent
For each fixed $\xi$ 
there exists the function
$x\mapsto H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)$
and we  apply the $L_*$-operator on  this $x$-dependent function and put:
\[ 
F(x,\xi;\kappa)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot L_*(x,\partial_x,\xi;\kappa)(H(x-\xi,\xi,\kappa) \tag{iii}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.3 Two  estimates.}}
The hypothesis that $\{a_{pq}(x)\}$ are of class $C^2$ and$\{a_p(x)\}$ of class $C^1$, together with
the limit conditions (*) in ¤ XX   give the existence of positive constants
$C,C_1$ and $k$ such that the following hold when $\kappa\geq\kappa_0$:
\[
|H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)|\leq C\cdot \frac{e^{-k\kappa|x-\xi|}}{|x-\xi|}
\tag{1.3.1}
\]
\[
[F(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq C_1\cdot 
\frac{e^{-k\kappa|x-\xi|^2}}{|x-\xi|^2}
\tag{1.3.2}
\]


\noindent
The verification is left as an exercise.



\bigskip





\noindent
{\bf{1.4 An integral equation.}}
We  seek
$\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ which solves the equation:
\[ 
\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)= \iiint\, F(x,y;\kappa)\cdot \Phi(y,\xi;\kappa)\,dy+F(x,\xi;\kappa)\tag{1}
\]
where the integral is taken over ${\bf{R}}^3$.
To solve (1)
we construct the Neumann series of $F$.
Thus, starting with $F^{(1)}=F$ we set
\[
F^{(k)}(x,\xi;\kappa)=\int_{{\bf{R}}^3}\, F(x,y;\kappa)\cdot
F^{(k-1)}(y,\xi;\kappa)\, dy\quad\colon\quad k\geq 2\tag{1.4.1}
\]
Then (1.3.2 ) gives  the inequality
\[
|F^{(2)}(x,\xi;\kappa)|
\leq C_1^2\iiint
\frac{e^{-k\kappa|\xi-y|^2}}{|x-y|^2\cdot |\xi-y|^2}\cdot dy\tag{i}
\]


\noindent
To estimate (i) we first notice that the triple integral after
the substitution $y-\xi\to u$
becomes
\[
C_1^2\iiint
\frac{e^{-k\kappa|u|^2}}{|x-u-\xi|^2\cdot |u|^2}\cdot du\tag{ii}
\]


\noindent
In  (ii)  the volume integral is integrated in polar
coordinates
and becomes
\[
C_1^2\cdot \int_0^\infty\int_{S^2}\, 
\frac{e^{-k\kappa r^2}}{|x-r\cdot w-\xi|^2}\cdot dwdr\tag{iii}
\]
where $S^2$ is the unit sphere and $dw$ the area measure on
$S^2$ and we see that (iii) becomes
\[
2\pi C_1^2\cdot
\int_0^\infty\int_0^\pi\, 
\frac{e^{-k\kappa r^2}}{(x-\xi)^2+r^2-
2r\cdot |x-\xi|\cdot \sin\theta}\cdot d\theta dr=
\]
\[
\frac{2\pi C_1^2}{|x-\xi|}\cdot\int_0^\infty\, e^{-k\kappa |x-\xi|t}\cdot
\log\, |\frac{1+t}{1-t}|\cdot \frac{dt}{t}\tag{iv}
\]
where the last equality follows by a straightforward computation.

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{1.5 Exercise.}}
Show that (iv) gives the estimate
\[
|F^{(2)}(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq \frac{2\pi C_1^2\cdot C_1^*}{\kappa\cdot |x-\xi|^2}
\]
where $C_1^*$ is a fixed positive constant
which is independent of $x$ and $\xi$ and 
show by an induction over $n$
that one has:
\[
|F^{(n)}(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq\frac{C_1}{|x-\xi|^2}\cdot 
\bigl[\frac{2\pi C_1^2\cdot C_1^*}{\kappa}\bigr]^{n-1}
\quad\text{hold for every}\quad  n\geq 2\tag{*}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.6 Conclusion.}}
With $\kappa$ so large that
$2\pi C_1^2\cdot C_1^*<\kappa$
it follows form (*) that
the series
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty F^{(n)}(x,\xi;\kappa)
\]
converges when $x\neq\xi$ and
this Neumann series
gives the requested solution $\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$.
Moreover, $\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ satisfies a similar estimate as in (1.3.2) above
with another  constant than $C_2$ instead of $C_1$.

there is a constant $C_\gamma$
such that
\[
\bigl |\Psi(x,\xi;\kappa)\,\bigr|\leq \frac{C_\gamma}{(\kappa|x-\xi|)^{\gamma}}
\]
hold for every pair $(x,\xi)$ and every $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$.
Together with  (1.3.1)  this gives
an estimate for the fundamental solution $\Phi$.

\centerline {\bf{2. Green's functions.}}
\bigskip


\noindent
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain in
${\bf{R}}^3$.
A Green's function $G(x,y;\kappa)$ attached to this domain
and the PDE-operator $P(x,\partial_x;\kappa)$
is a function which for fixed $\kappa$ is a function in 
$\Omega\times\Omega$
with the following properties:
\[ 
G(x,y;\kappa)=0\quad\text{when}\quad x\in\partial \Omega\quad \text{and}\quad
y\in\Omega\tag{*}
\]
\[
\psi(y)=\int_\Omega\, (P^*(x,\partial_x)-\kappa^2)
(\psi(x))\cdot G(x,y;\kappa)\, dx\quad\colon\quad y\in\Omega\tag{**}
\]


\noindent
hold for all $C^2$-functions $\psi$ with compact support in
$\Omega$.
To find $G$ we 
solve  Dirchlet problems.
With
$\xi\in\Omega$ kept fixed one has the continuous function on
$\partial\Omega$:
\[ 
x\mapsto \Phi^*(x,\xi;\kappa)
\]



\noindent
Solving Dirchlet's problem gives  a unique $C^2$-function
$w(x)$ which satisfies:
\[ 
P(x,\partial_x)(w)+\kappa^2\cdot w=0 \quad\text{holds  in}\quad \Omega
\quad\text{and}\quad w(x)= \Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)\quad\colon x\in\partial\Omega=0
\]

\medskip

\noindent
From the above it is clear that
this gives the requested $G$-function, i.e. one has:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.1 Proposition.}} \emph{The 
the function }
\[ 
G(x,\xi;\kappa)=
\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)-w(x)
\quad \text{satisfies}\quad (*-**)
\]


 
\noindent
Using the estimates for the $\phi$-function from ¤ 1
we get
estimates for the $G$-function above.
Start with  a sufficiently large
$\kappa_0$ so  that 
$\Phi^*(x,\xi;\kappa_0)$ is a positive function of
$(x,\xi)$. Then the following hold:
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{2.2 Theorem.}}
\emph{One has}
\[ 
G(x,\xi;\kappa_0)=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Delta(x)}\cdot\sqrt{\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa_0)}}
+R(x,\xi)
\]

\noindent
\emph{where the remainder function satisfies the following for all pairs
$(x,\xi)$ in $\Omega$:}
\[ 
|R(x,\xi)|\leq C\cdot |x-\xi|^{-\frac{1}{4}}
\]


\noindent
\emph{and the   constant $C$ only  depends on the  domain 
$\Omega$ and
the PDE-operator $P$.}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
Above the negative power  of 
$|x-\xi|$ is  a fourth-root which means that  the remainder term $R$ 
is more regular  compared
to the first term which behaves like $|x-\xi|^{-1}$ on the diagonal $x=\xi$.

\centerline {\bf{2.4 The integral operator
$\mathcal J$}}. 
\medskip


\noindent
With $\kappa_0$ chosen as above
we
consider the integral operator
which sends a function
$u$ in $\Omega$ to 
\[
\mathcal J_u(x)=\int_\Omega\, G(x,\xi;\kappa_0)\cdot u(\xi)\, d\xi
\]


\noindent
The construction of the Green's function gives:
\[
(P-\kappa_0^2)(\mathcal J_u)(x)=u(x)\quad\colon\quad x\in\Omega\tag{2.4.1}
\] 
In other words, if $E$ denotes the identity we have
the operator equality

\[
P(x,\partial_x)\circ \mathcal J_u=\kappa_0^2\cdot  \mathcal J+E\tag{2.4.2}
\]



\noindent
Consider pairs $(u,\gamma)$ such that 
\[
u(x)+ \gamma\cdot \mathcal J_u(x)=0\quad\colon\quad x\in\Omega\tag{2.4.3}
\] 
The vanishing from (*) for the $G$-function 
implies that $J_u(x)=0$ on $\partial\Omega$. Hence  every
$u$-function which satisfies
in (2.4.3) for some  constant $\gamma$
vanishes   on $\partial\Omega$.
Next, apply $P$ to (2.4.3) and then
the operator formula (2.4.2) gives

\[
0=P(u)+\gamma \kappa_0^2\cdot \mathcal J_u+\gamma\cdot u\implies
P(u)+(\gamma-\kappa_0^2)u=0
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\emph{2.4.4 Conclusion.}}
Hence the boundary value problem (*) from 0.B
is equivalent to find eigenfunctions of 
$\mathcal J$ via (2.4.3) above.

\medskip

\noindent
\centerline {\bf{3. Almost reality of eigenvalues.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Consider the set of eigenvalues $\lambda$ to (*) in (0.B).
Then we have:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{3.1 Proposition.}}
\emph{There exist positive constants $C_*$ and $c_*$ such that
every eigenvalue  $\lambda$ to  (*) in (0.B) satisfies}

\[
|\mathfrak{Im}\,\lambda|^2\leq C_*(\mathfrak{Re}\,\lambda)+c_*)
\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Let $u$ be an eigenfunction where
$P(u)+\lambda\cdot u=0$.
Stokes theorem and the vanishing of $u|\partial\Omega$
give:
\[
0=\int_\Omega\, \bar u\cdot (P+\lambda)(u)\,dx
=-\int_\Omega \, \sum_{p,q}\, a_{pq}(x)\cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}
\frac {\partial \bar u}{\partial x_q}\, dx+
\int_\Omega\, \bar u\cdot( \sum \, a_p(x)
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}\,)\, dx+
\] 
\[
\int_\Omega\, |u(x)|^2\cdot b(x)\, dx+
\lambda\cdot \int\, |u(x)|^2\, dx
\]
\medskip


\noindent
Write $\lambda=\xi+i\eta$.
Separating real and imaginary parts we find the two equations:
\[
\xi\int\, |u|^2\, dx=
\int\, \sum_{p,q} a_{p,q}(x)\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}\cdot 
\frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial x_q}\, dx+
\int\, \bigl(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \sum\, \frac{\partial a_p}{\partial x_p}- b\,\bigr )
\cdot |u|^2\, dx\tag{i}
\]
\[
\eta\int\, |u|^2\, dx=\frac{1}{2i}\int \sum\, a_p\bigl(
u\frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial x_p}-
\bar u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}\,\bigl )\, dx\tag{ii}
\]


\noindent
Set
\[ A= \int\, |u|^2\,dx\quad\colon\quad
B= \int\, |\nabla(u)|^2\,dx
\]
Since $P$ is elliptic there exists a positive constant $k$ such that
\[
\sum_{p,q} a_{p,q}(x)\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}>
k\cdot |\nabla(u)|^2
\]
From this we see that (i-ii) gives positive constants $c_1,c_2,c_3$ such that
\[
A\xi>c_1B-c_2B\quad\colon\quad A|\eta|<c_3\cdot \sqrt{AB}\tag{iii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Here (iii) implies that $\xi>-c_2$ and the reader can also confirm that
\[ 
B<\frac{A}{c-1}(\xi+c-2)\quad\colon\quad
A|\eta|< A\cdot c_2\cdot \sqrt{\frac{\xi+c_2}{c_1}}\quad\colon\quad
|\eta|< c_3\cdot \sqrt{\frac{\xi+c_2}{c_1}}\tag{iv}
\]


\noindent Finally it is obvious that (iv) above gives the requested
inequality in Proposition 3.1.

\bigskip

\centerline{\bf{4. The asymptotic  formula.}}
\bigskip


\noindent
Using the results above
where we have found  a good control of the integral operator
$\mathcal J$ and the identification of eigenvalues to $\mathcal j$ and those from (*) in (0.B), one can proceed and apply Tauberian theorems to derive
the asymptotic formula  in Theorem 1 using 
similar methods as described in ¤ XX where we treated
the Laplace operator. 
For details the reader may consult [Carleman:p age xx-xx].

\centerline {\bf{A.5. Operators with closed graph.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Let $T$ be a densely defined operator. In the product $X\times X$
we get the graph:
\[ 
\Gamma(T)=\{(x,Tx)\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\}\tag{A.5.1}
\]
If $\Gamma(T)$  is a closed subspace of $X\times X$ we say that
$T$ is closed.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.5.1 Exercise.}}
Let $T$ be densely defined and assume
that 
$\sigma(T)$ is not the whole complex plane.
Show that  $T$ is automatically closed.
\medskip

\noindent
In the study of spectra we shall foremost
restrict the attention to 
closed operators.
Assume  that $T$ is densely defined and closed.
Let $\lambda$ be a 
complex number  
such that (i) holds in (A.1) for some
constant $c$ and 
the range of
$\lambda\cdot E-T$ is dense. 
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.5.2 Exercise.}}
Show that the closedness of
$T$ implies that  
the range of $\lambda\cdot E-T$ is equal to $X$ so that 
$R_T(\lambda)$ exists.
A hint is that  if $y\in X$, then the  density gives
a sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $\mathcal D(T)$ such that
$\xi_n=\lambda\cdot x_n-T(x_n)\to y$.
In particular $\{\xi_n\}$ is a Cauchy- sequence
By (i) in
(A.1) we have
\[
||x_n-x_m||\leq c^{-1}\cdot ||\xi_n-\xi_m||
\]
Hence $\{x_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence and
since
$X$ is a Banach space
there exists $x\in S$ such that $x_n\to x$.
But then $\{(x_n,T(x_n))=
(x_n,\lambda\cdot x_n-\xi_n)$
converges to $(x,\lambda\cdot x-y)$
and since
$T$ is closed it follows that $(x,\lambda\cdot x-y)\in \Gamma(T)$
which gives the requested surjectivity since
\[
T(x)=\lambda\cdot x-y\implies y=(\lambda\cdot E-T)(x)
\]
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.5.3 Adjoints.}}
Let $T$ be densely defined
but not necessarily closed.
In the dual space $X^*$ we get  the subspace
of  vectors $y$ for which   there exists a constant
$C(y)$ such that
\[
|y(Tx)|\leq C(y)\cdot ||x||\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{i}
\]
When (i) holds the density of $\mathcal D(T)$
gives  a unique vector 
$T^*(y)$ in $X^*$ 
such that
\[
y(Tx)= T^*(y)(x)\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{ii}
\]
One refers to $T^*$ as the adjoint operator of $T$ whose
domain of definition is denoted by
$\mathcal D(T^*)$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that $T^*$ has a closed graph.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.5.4 Closed extensions.}}
Let $T$ be densely defined
but not closed.
The question arises when
the closure of $\Gamma(T)$ is the graph of a linear operator
$\widehat{T}$ and then 
we refer to
$\widehat{T}$ as a closed extension of $T$.
A sufficient condition for the existence of a close extension goes as follows:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.5.5 Theorem.}}
\emph{If 
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ is    dense in  $X^*$ then $T$ has a closed extension.}
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Consider the graph 
 $\Gamma(T)$
and let 
$\{x_n\}$ and $\{\xi_n\}$
be two sequences in $\mathcal D(T)$ which both converge to a point
$p\in X$ while 
$T(x_n)\to y_1$ and $T(\xi_n)\to y_2$ hold 
for some pair $y_1,y_2$. We must rove that $y_1=y_2$.
To achieve this we take some
$x^*\in \mathcal D(T^*)$ which gives
\[
x^*(y_1)= \lim \,x^*(Tx_n)= \lim\,T^*(x^*)(x_n)= T^*(x^*)(p)
\]
In the same way we get $x^*(y_2)=T^*(x^*)(p)$. 
Now the density of $\mathcal D(T^*)$ gives $y_1=y_2$
which proves that
the closure of $\Gamma(T)$ is a graphic subset of $X\times X$
and gives the closed   operator $\widehat{T}$
with 
\[
\Gamma(\widehat{T})=
\overline{\Gamma(T)}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{A.5.6 Remark.}}
In general, let $T$ be closed and densely defined.
There may exist several  closed operators $S$
with the property that
\[
\Gamma(T)\subset \Gamma(S)
\]
Passing to  adjoint operators the
reader may verify that
the density of
$\mathcal D(T)$ implies that
\[ 
T^*= S^*
\]
hold for every closed extension  $S$.

\centerline{\bf{A.6 Operational calculus.}}
\medskip


\noindent
Let $T$ be densely defined and closed.
To each pair $(\gamma,f)$, where
$\gamma$ is a rectifiable Jordan
arc contained in
${\bf{C}}\setminus \sigma(T)$
and $f\in C^0(\gamma)$, there exists the bounded linear operator
\[ 
T_{(\gamma,f)}=\int_\gamma\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz\tag{A.6.1}
\]
The integrand has values in the Banach space of bounded
linear operators on $X$ and (A.6.1)  is calculated
by Riemann sums. Next, 
Neumann's equation  (A.3)
entails that
$R_T(z_1)$ and $R_T(z_2)$
commute for all pairs $z_1,z_2$ on $\gamma$.
From this it is clear that
if
$g$ is another function in
 $C^0(\gamma)$,
then  the operators
$T_{f,\gamma}$
and $T_{g,\gamma}$
commute. Moreover, for each $f\in C^0(\gamma)$
the reader may verify that
the closedeness of $T$
implies that
the range of
$T_{f,\gamma}$ is contained in
$\mathcal D(T)$ and 
\[
T_{f,\gamma}\circ T(x)= T\circ T_{f,\gamma}(x)
\quad\colon x\in \mathcal D(T)
\]


 

\medskip

\noindent
Next, let $\Omega$ be an open set of class $\mathcal D(C^1)$, i.e.
$\partial\Omega$ is a finite union of
closed differentiable Jordan curves. 
When
$\partial\Omega\,\cap \sigma(T)=\emptyset$
we construct the line integrals  (A.6.1)
for continuous functions on
the boundary.
Consider the algebra $\mathcal A(\Omega)$
of analytic functions in
$\Omega$ which extend to be continuous on the closure.
Each $f\in \mathcal A(\Omega)$
gives the operator
\[ 
T_f=
\int_{\partial\Omega}\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz\tag{A.6.2}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.6.3 Theorem.}}
\emph{The map $f\mapsto T_f$ is an algebra homomorphism from
$\mathcal A(\Omega)$ into a commutative algebra of bounded
linear operators on $X$ whose  image is  a commutative algebra of 
bounded linear operators
denoted by $T(\Omega)$.}

\medskip

\noindent
{\emph{Proof.}}
Let $f,g$ be a pair in $\mathcal A(\Omega)$. We must show the equality
\[
T_{gf}= T_f\circ T_g\tag{*}
\]
To attain this 
we choose  a slightly  smaller open
set $\Omega_*\subset\Omega$ which again is of class $\mathcal D(C^1)$
and each of it  bounding Jordan curve is close to one 
boundary curve in
$\partial\Omega$ and $\Omega\setminus \Omega_*$ does not
intersect $\sigma(T)$.
By Cauchy's theorem we can shift the integration to
$\partial\Omega_*$ and get
\[
T_g=
\int_{\partial\Omega_*}\, g(z)R_T(z_*)\, dz_*\tag{i}
\]
where we use  $z_*$ to indicate that integration takes place
along
$\partial\Omega_*$. Now
\[
T_f\circ T_g=
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, f(z)g(z_*)R_T(z)\circ
R_T(z_*)\, dz_*dz\tag{ii}
\]
Neumann's equation
(*) from  (A.3) entails that  the right hand side in
(ii) becomes
\[
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, \frac{f(z)g(z_*)R_T(z_*)}{z-z_*}
\, dz_*dz+
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, \frac{f(z)g(z_*)R_T(z)}{z-z_*}
\, dz_*dz=A+B
\tag{iii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Here $A$ is  evaluated
by first integrating with respect to $z$ and 
Cauchy's theorem gives
\[
f(z_*)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot 
\iint_{\partial\Omega }\frac{f(z)}{z-z_*}\quad\colon z_*\in\partial\Omega_*
\, dz
\]
It follows that
\[ 
A=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, f(z_*)g(z_*)R_T(z_*)\, dz_*
=T_{fg}
\]
Next, $B$ is evaluated when we first integrate with respect to $z_*$. Here
\[
\iint_{\partial\Omega}\frac{g(z_*)}{z-z_*}\quad\colon z\in\partial\Omega
\]
which entails that $B=0$ and the theorem  follows.
\medskip


\centerline {\bf{A.7 Spectral gap sets.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Let
$K$ be a compact subset
of $\sigma(T)$ 
such that
$\sigma(T)\setminus K$ is a closed
set in ${\bf{C}}$.
This implies that if $V$ is an open  neighborhood of $K$, then
there exists a relatively compact subdomain
$U\in \mathcal D(C^1)$ which contains
$K$ as a compact subset while $\partial U\cap \sigma(T)= \emptyset$.
To every such domain $U$ we can apply Theorem A.6.3.
If $U_*\subset U$ for a pair of such domains
we can restrict functions in
$\mathcal A(U)$ to $U_*$. This
yields an algebra homomorphism
\[
\mathcal T(U)\to \mathcal T(U_*)
\]
Next, denote by
$\mathcal O(K)$ the algebra of germs of analytic functions
on $K$.
So each $f\in \mathcal O(K)$ 
comes from
some analytic function in a domain $U$ as above.
The resulting operator $T_U(f)$ depends on the germ $f$ only.
In fact, this follows because if
$f\in \mathcal A(U)$ and
$U_*\subset U$ is a similar 
$\mathcal D(C^1)$-domain which again contains
$K$, then
Cauchy's vanishing theorem in analytic function theory
applies
to $f(z)R_T(z)$ in $U\setminus \bar U_*$ and entails that
\[
\int_{\partial U_*}\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz=
\int_{\partial U}\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz
\]
Hence there exists an algebra homorphism
from $\mathcal O(K)$ into a commutative algebra
of bounded linear operators on $X$
denoted by $\mathcal T(K)$.
The identity in $\mathcal T(K)$
is denoted
by $E_K$ and called 
the spectral projection operator
attached to the compact set $K$ in
$\sigma(T)$. By this construction one has
\[
E_K=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{\partial U}\, R_T(z)\, dz
\] 
for every open domain $U$ surrounding
$K$ as above.


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.7.1 The operator $T_K$.}} When $K$ is a compact spectral gap set of $T$
we set
\[
 T_K=TE_K
\]
This  is a  bounded linear operator  given
by
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{\partial U}\, z\cdot R_T(z)\, dz
\] 
where $U$ is a domain as above which contains  $K$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.7.2 Theorem.}} \emph{Identify
$T_K$ with a linear  operator on
the subspace $E_K(X)$. Then one has the equality}
\[
\sigma(T_K)=K
\]
\emph{Proof.}
If $\lambda_0$ is outside $K$ we can choose
$U$ so that $\lambda_0$ is outside $\bar U$
and construct the operator
\[
S=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{\partial U}\, \frac{1}{\lambda_0-z}\cdot R_T(z)\, dz
\]
The operational calculus gives
\[
S(\lambda_0 E_K-T)= E_K
\]
here $E_K$ is the identity operator on
$E_K(X)$ which shows that
$\sigma(T_K)\subset K$.


\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.7.3  Discrete spectra.}}
Consider 
a spectral set  reduced to a singleton set
$\{\lambda_0\}$, i.e.
$\lambda_0$ is an isolated point in
$\sigma(T)$. The associated spectral projection is denoted by
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ and
given by
\[
E_T(\lambda_0)=
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{|\lambda-\lambda_0|=\epsilon}\,
R_T(\lambda)\, d\lambda
\]
for all sufficiently small $\epsilon$.
Now
$R_T(\lambda)$ is an analytic function defined
in some punctured disc
$\{0<\lambda-\lambda_0|<\delta\}$
with  a Laurent expansion
\[
R_T(\lambda)=\sum_{-\infty}^\infty\, 
(\lambda-\lambda_0)^k\cdot B_k
\]
where $\{B_k\}$ are bounded linear operators
obtained  by residue formulas:
\[
B_k= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot
\int_{|\lambda|=\epsilon}\,  
\frac{R_T(\lambda)}{(\lambda-\lambda_0)^{k+1}}\, d\lambda
\quad\colon\,\epsilon<\delta
\]


\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that
$R_T(\lambda)$ is meromorphic, i.e. 
$B_k=0$ hold when $k<<0$,
if and only if there
exists a constant $C$ and some integer $M\geq 0$ such that
the operator norms satisfy
\[
||R_T(\lambda)||\leq C\cdot |\lambda-\lambda_0)^{-M}
\]
\medskip


\noindent
Suppose now that 
$R_T$ has a pole of some order $M\geq 1$ at $\lambda_0$
which gives a series expansion
\[
R_T(\lambda)=\sum_1^M\,
\frac{B_{-k}}{(\lambda-\lambda_0)^k}+
\sum_0^\infty\, 
(\lambda-\lambda_0)^k\cdot B_k\tag{i}
\]
Residue calculus gives
\[
B_{-1}=E_T(\lambda_0)\tag{ii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The case of a simple  pole.}}
Suppose that $M=1$. Then it is clear that
Operational calculus gives
\[
\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{|\lambda-\lambda_0|=\epsilon}\,
(\lambda-\lambda_0)R(\lambda)\, d\lambda=0\tag{iii}
\]
This vanishing and operational calculus entail that
\[
(\lambda_0E-T)E_T(\lambda_0)=0
\]
which means that the ragne of the projection operator
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ is equal to the kernel of
$\lambda_0\cdot E-T$, i.e. the set of eigenvectors $x$ for which
\[
 Tx=\lambda_0\cdot x
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The case $M\geq 2$}}.
To begin with residue calculus 
identifies (iii) with $B_2$ and at the same time operational calculus
which aftera reversed sign gives
\[
(\lambda_0E-T)E_T(\lambda_0)=-B_2
\]
Since $E_T(\lambda_0)$ is a projection which commutes with
$T$ it follows that
\[
E_T(\lambda_0)\cdot B_2= B_2\cdot E_T(\lambda_0)=B_2
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that if $M\geq 3$ then
\[
(\lambda_0E-T)^k\cdot E_T(\lambda_0)=(-1)^k\cdot B_{k+1}
\quad\colon 2\leq k\leq M
\]
Consider also the subspaces
\[
\mathcal N_k(\lambda_0)= 
\{ x\colon (\lambda_0E-T)^k(x)=0\}
\quad\colon 1\leq k\leq M
\]
and show that they are non-decreasing and
for every  $k>M$ one has
\[
\mathcal N_M(\lambda_0)=\{ x\colon (\lambda_0E-T)^k(x)=0\}
\]



\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.7.4 The case when
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ has a finite dimensional range.}}
Here  the operator $T(\lambda_0)= TE_T(\lambda_0)$
acts on this finite dimensional vector space
which entails that
the nullspaces $\{\mathcal N_k(\lambda_0)\}$ above are
finite dimensional and if $M$ is the order of the pole
one has
\[
(T(\lambda_0)-\lambda_0)^M=0
\]
So $\lambda_0$ is the sole eigenvalue of $T(\lambda_0)$.
Moreover, the finite dimensional range of $E_T(\lambda_0)$
has dimension equal to that of $\mathcal N_M(\lambda_0)$.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Recall l that finite dimensional subspaces appear as
direct sum compoinetns. So if
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ is finite dimensional there exists a direct sum decomposition
\[
X=E_T(\lambda_0)(X)\oplus E-E_T(\lambda_0)
\]
where  $V=E-E_T(\lambda_0)$ is a closed subspace of $X$.
Show that $V$ is $T$-invariant 
and  that there exists
some $c>0$ such that
\[
||\lambda_0x-Tx||\geq ||x||\quad x\in V\cap \mathcal D(T)
\]

\] 
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality entails that if
$x\in \ell^2$ then
the series
\[
\sum_{q=0}^\infty c_{p,q}\cdot x_q\tag{2}
\] 
converges absolutely for
each $p$ and let  $y_p$ denote the sum.
But  (1) does not imply that
$\{y_p\}$ belongs to $\ell^2$.
So we  get a subspace $\mathcal D$ of $\ell^2$
which consists of vectors
$x$ such that
\[
\sum_{p=0}^\infty \, \bigl|\sum_{q=0}^\infty c_{p,q}\cdot x_q\bigr|^2<\infty\tag{3}
\]
Notice that (1) implies that
$\mathcal D$ contains
the $\ell^2$-vectors $\{x_p\}$ for which only finitely many
$x_p$ are non-zero.
It follows that
$\mathcal D$ is 
a dense subspace of
$\ell^2$ which gives
the densely defined linear operator
$S$  sending a vector $x$
to the vector $Sx=y$  where
\[ 
y_p=\sum_{q=0}^\infty  c_{qp}\cdot x_q\quad\colon p=0,1,2\ldots
\]
By definition the domain of definition of $S$ is
the subspace $\mathcal D$ of $\ell^2$.
In an article from 1920 Carleman contructed an "ugly  example" of a doubly
indexed sequence
$\{c_{pq}\}$ of real  numbers
satisfying (1) and the symmetri condition
$c_{pq}=c_{qp}$, and yet there exists a non-zero complex vector
$\{x_p=a_p+ib_p\}$ in $\ell^2$ such that
\[ 
S(x)= ix\tag{4}
\]
This should be compared with
the finite dimensional case where
the spectral theorem due to Cauchy and Weierstrass asserts that
if
$A$ is a real and symmetric $N\times N$-matrix for some
positive integer $N$, then there exists an orthogonal
$N\times N$-matrix $U$ such that
$UAU^*$ is a diagonal matrix with real elements.
Carleman  extended this finite dimensional result 
to infinite Hermitian matrices 
for which the densely defined linear operator $S$ has no eigenvectors with
eigenvalue $i$ or $-i$.
More precisely, one says that
the densely defined operator $S$ is of Type I
if the equations
\[
S(z)= iz\quad\colon S(\zeta)= -i\zeta\tag{*}
 \] 
 do not have non-zero solutions with complex vectors
 $z$ or $\zeta$ in $\ell^2$.
 The major result in the cited monograph is as follows:
 \medskip
 
 
 \noindent
 {\bf{Theorem.}}
\emph{Each densely Hermitian operator $S$ of type I has  a unique
adapted resolution of the identity.}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
The
notion spectral resolutions
is given in (0.2) below.
For a bounded Hermitian operator the existence of
an adapted resolution of the identity  was proved by
Hilbert in 1904
whose pioneering work together with
Fredholm's previous studies of integral equations
was put forward
in Carleman's lecture at the IMU-congress in 1932:
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{La thorie, cre par Hilbert, des formes quadratiques (ou hermitiennes)
 une infinit de variables en connexion avec la thorie
des quations intgrales  noyeau symmetrique est certainement
la plus importante dcouverte qui ait t faite dans la
thorie des quations intgrales
aprs les travaux  fondamentaux de Fredholm.}
\medskip


\centerline {\bf{0.1 Applications to quantum mechanics.}}
\medskip

\noindent
The work by Fredholm, Hilbert and Carleman
was foremost motivated by applications to
integral equations and resolvents of 
various PDE-equations
which stem from
physics prior to quantum mechanics.
It was therefore quite exciting  when
Niels Bohr in a lecture held at the Scandinavian Congress  in
Copenhagen 1925, talked about the new quantum mechanics
and  adressed new problems
to the
mathematical  community.
Recall that a crucial point in
quantum mechanics 
is the hypothesis on energy levels which correspond to 
orbits in Bohr's theory of atoms. 
For this  physical  background
the  reader should
consult 
Bohr's  
plenary talk when 
he received the Nobel Prize in physics 1923.
In the "new-born" quantum mechanics
the following second order PDE-equation plays a crucial role:
\[ 
\Delta\phi+2m\cdot\bigl( E-U\bigr)\bigl(\frac{2\pi}{h}\bigr)^2\cdot \phi=0\tag{*}
\] 
Here $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator in the 3-dimensional $(x,y,z)$-space,
$m$ the mass of a particle and $h$  Planck's constant
while   $U(x,y,z)$ is a potential function.
Finally $E$ is a parameter and one seeks values on $E$
such that (*) has a solution $\phi$
which belongs to $L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$.
Leaving physics aside, the  mathematical problem
amounts to study   second order
PDE-operators:
\[ 
L=\Delta+c(x,y,z)\quad\colon
\Delta=\partial_x^2+\partial_y^2+\partial_z^2\tag{**}
\]
where $c(x,y,z)$ is a real-valued and Lebesgue measurable
function
which is locally square integrable in
${\bf{R}}^3$. 
Above
$L$ 
is   defined on the
dense subspace of $L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$ which
consists of
test-functions. Moreover, 
Greens' formula entails that it is symmetric, i.e. for each pair $f,g$ in
$C_0^\infty({\bf{R}}^3)$ one has:
\[
\iint\, L(f)\cdot g\, dxdydz=
\iint\, L(g)\cdot f\, dxdydz
\]
So the study  of the operators in (*)
amounts precisely to determine under which conditions on
the potential function $c$ the favourable Case I holds.
Complete answers were given by Carleman
in   his  lectures  \emph{La thorie des quations intgrales singulires}
held at Institut Poincar in 1930. 
In physical  applications one is foremost concerned with  the
case
when $c$ is  a potential function
\[ 
W(p)=\sum\,\frac{\alpha_k}{|p-q_k|}+\beta
\] 
where $\{q_k\}$ is a finite subset of
${\bf{R}}^3$  and  $\{\alpha_k\}$ and 
$\beta$ are real and positive numbers. For this special $c$-function
the results from Carleman's cited monograph imply
that
the densely defined operator $L$ is of type I
and that the real spectrum of $L$ is a discrete sequence of real numbers
whose absolute values tend to $+\infty$.
We shall review Carleman's account about
this case from his lectures in Paris
in
the subsequent sections.
A general result 
appears in his
article
\emph{Sur la thorie mathmatique de l'quation de Schrdinger}
[Arkiv fr matematik och fysik:  1934] and goes as follows:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem }}
\emph{
If there 
exists if there is a  constant $M$
such that}
\[
\limsup_{x^2+y^2+z^2\to \infty}\, c(x,y,z)\leq M
\]
\emph{Then the   densely defined operator $L$ is of type 1}.

\medskip


\noindent{{\bf{Remark. }} Hundreds - or rather thousands -  of 
articles have later exposed
the Bohr-Schrdinger equation with
various variants where one for example  introduce
boundary value conditions and a time variable which leads to
Schrdinger's equation
\[ 
i\cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,y,z,t)=L(u)(x,y,z,t)
\]
where $t$ is a time variable.
In all these studies the spectral theorem
for unbounded self-adjoint operators plays a significant role.
In the subsequent sections we  expose
Carleman's  solution to  (*) when $L=\Delta+c$
is of Case 1 and has a spectrum confined
to an interval $[\ell,+\infty)$ for some positive real number $\ell$.










\centerline{\bf{0.2 Resolutions of the identity.}}
\medskip


\noindent
Following Hilbert we recall the
notion spectral resolutions.
A   resolution  of the identity on
$\ell^2$ consists of a 
family $\{E(\lambda)\}$
of self-adjoint projections, indexed by real numbers
$\lambda$  which satisfies  (A-C) below.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A}}. Each $E(\lambda)$ 
is an orthogonal projection from
$\ell^2$ onto the range $E(\lambda)(\ell^2)$ and 
these operators commute pairwise, i.e.
\[
E(\lambda)\cdot E(\mu)=
E(\mu)\cdot E(\lambda)\tag{i}
\]
hold for pairs of real numbers. Moreover, for each 
$x\in\ell^2$ one has 
\[ 
\lim_{\lambda+\infty}\,||E(\lambda)(x)-x||=0
\quad\colon
\lim_{\lambda\to -\infty}\,||E(\lambda)(x)||=0\tag{ii}
\] 

\noindent {\bf{B}}.
To each pair of real numbers
$a<b$ we set
\[ 
E_{a,b}= E(b)-E(a)
\]
Then
\[
E_{a,b}\cdot
E_{c,d}=0\tag{iii}
\] 
for each pair of disjoint interval
$[a,b]$ and $[b,c]$.

\medskip

\noindent {\bf{C}}.
Notice first that if $\mu<\lambda$ for a pair of real numbers
and $x\in\ell^2$ then
(ii) gives
\[
E(\mu)[E-E(\lambda)](x)=
\lim_{s\to+\infty}\, (E\mu)-E(-s))(E(s)-E(\lambda)(x)
\]
By (iii) the last product is zero as soon as
$s>\lambda$ and $-s<\mu$ and hence we have
\[
E(\mu)= E(\mu)E(\lambda)
\]
It means that the range $E(\mu)(\ell^2)$ increases with
$\mu$ and from this it is clear that
when  $x\in\ell^2$ then the real-valued function 
\[ 
\lambda\mapsto\langle E(\lambda)(x),x\rangle\tag{c}
\] 
is a real-valued and  non-decreasing function.
Hilbert's  last condition is that the non-dcreasing
function in (c)
is right continuous for
every fixed 
$x$.
\medskip



\centerline {\bf{$S$-adapted resolutions.}}
\medskip


\noindent
Let $S$ be a densely defined linear operator on
$\ell^2$.
A spectral resolution  $\{E(\lambda)\}$ of the identity
is $S$-adapted if the following  hold:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.1}} For each interval bounded $[a,b]$ the range of
$E_{a,b}$ from (B) above
is contained in $\mathcal D(S)$
 and 
\[
E_{a,b}(Sx)=S\circ E_{a,b}(x)
\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(S)
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{B.1 }} By (C)  each  $x\in\ell^2$
gives the non-decreasing function
$\lambda\mapsto\langle E(\lambda)(x),x\rangle$ on the  real line.
Together with the right continuity in (c) there exist
Stieltjes' integrals
\[
\int_a^b\, \lambda\cdot \langle dE(\lambda)(x),x\rangle
\] 
for each bounded interval.
Carleman's  second condition for 
$\{E(\lambda)\}$  to be $S$-adapted is that
a vector $x$ belongs to $\mathcal D(S)$ if and only if
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \, |\lambda|\cdot \langle dE(\lambda)(x),x\rangle<\infty\tag{b.1}
\] 


\noindent
{\bf{C.1}} The last  condition is that
\[
\langle Sx,y\rangle=
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \, \lambda\cdot \langle dE(\lambda)(x),y\rangle
\quad\colon x,y\in\mathcal D(S)\tag{c.1}
\]
where (b.1) and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
entail that the Stieltjes' integral in (c.1) is absolutely convergent.

\centerline{\bf{Mathematics by Carleman}}
\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{Introduction.}}
Carleman's  collected work 
covers  fifty  articles of   high standard together with several monographs.
He became  professor at Stockholm University in 1924 when 
he replaced the chair by Helge von Koch.
From 1927  he also served  director at  Institute Mittag-Leffler
where he delivered frequent    seminars during the period  1928-1938.
His text-book for undergraduate mathematics published in 1926
was used for several decades.
Personally I find it outstanding
as a beginner's text for students
and during my early  education Carleman's presentation of 
basic material in analysis and
algebra
served as a "veritable bible".
His last major publication  was \emph{Sur un problme d'unicit pour les systmes
d'quations aux drivees partielles  deux variables
indpendantes} [Arkiv fr matematik 1938] concerned with a
uniqueness theorem for  elliptic PDE-systems 
where the variable coefficients of the PDE-operators  
are
non-analytic which 
extended an earlier   result by  Erik Holmgren
when the coefficients are real-analytic.
Let us recall  that Holmgren served as supervisor while Carleman prepared
his thesis entitled \emph{ber das Neumann-Poincarsche
Problem fr ein Gebiet mit Ecken}, presented 
at Uppsala University in 1916 when he was 23 years old.
To this one can add that Carleman got much inspiration from
Ivar Fredholm's work
on integral equations. At that time  
Fredholm was professor in mathematical physics at
Stockholm University and considered as the leading mathematician in Sweden.



\medskip

\noindent
Carleman was   aware of the interplay between
"pure mathematics" and experimental sciences which inspired his own  research.
After World War I he studied a year at an engineering school
in Paris. The article entitled \emph{ Sur les quations diffrentielles
de la mecanique d'avion} published in
[La Technique Aronautique, vol. 10  1921), inspired by  Lanchester's pioneering work 
\emph{Le vol arien}
which played a significant role while airplanes were
designed
at an early stage.
Carlemans article end with
the following conclusion
after an investigation of integral curves
to a certain non-linear differential system:
\emph{Quelle que soit la vitesse initiale, l'avion, aprs avoir
xecut s'il y lieu, un nombre fini des loopings, prend un mouvement
qui s'approche indfinement du rgime de descente
rectiligne ert uniforme.}

\medskip

\noindent
The  reader may also  consult
his  lecture
held 1944 at the Academy of Science in Sweden entitled
\emph{Sur l'action  rciproque entre les mathmatiques
et les sciences exprimentales exactes}
which underlines Carleman's  concern about applictions of mathematics.

\medskip

\noindent
During the last years in
life Carleman  suffered from health problems which caused his decease on
January 11 1949 at the age of 56 years.
A memorial article about his  scientific achievement
appears in [Acta. Math. 1950] by
Fritz Carlson
who was Carleman's collegue at 
the department of mathematics at Stockholm
university for several decades.
See also his collected work
published by Institute Mittag-Leffler in 1960.

\medskip

\noindent
In this lecture we pay attention to
Carleman's  
monograph  \emph{Sur les quations singulires
 noyaux rel et
symmetrique} [Uppsala University 1923] where 
the existence of 
spectral resolutions for unbounded
and self-adjoint
operators on a Hilbert space was established.
The expositary 
article 
\emph{La theorie des equations intgrales singulirs} [
Ann. l'Institut Poincar Vol. 1 (1931)] from his lectures in Paris
during the spring 1930 gives a good introduction to
the more involved material in
the cited work above and contains also instructive examples.
In ¤ 5 we establish an "abstract version" of the spectral
theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators,
but remark that in many applications it is convenient to adapt
the rather explicit contructions which
occur in the above mentioned references,
The material  in ¤ 0.3 about the Schrdinger equation illustrates this.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{An example.}}.
A basic equation which emerges from quantum mechanics is
to find solutions $u(p,t)$ defined in
${\bf{R}}^3\times {\bf{R}}^+$
where $t$ 
is a time variable and $p=(x,y,z)$
which satisfies the PDE-equation
\[ 
i\cdot\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\Delta(u)(p,t)- c(p)\cdot u(p,t)= 0 \quad t>0
\]
and the initial condition
\[ 
u(p,0)= f(p)
\]
Here $f(p)$ belongs to $L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$
and $c(p)$  is a real-valued and locally square integrable function.
Carleman proved that this
equation has solutions under the condition that
\[
\limsup_{p|\to \infty}\, c(p)\leq M
\]
holds for some constant $M$
and the spectrum of the densely defined sefl-adjoint 
operator $\Delta-c$ on
the Hilbert space
$L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$ is confined to an interval 
$[\lambda_1,+\infty)$ on the positive real line, i.e. here
$\lambda_1>0$.
When this holds  the solution $u$ is given
by an equatiuon
\[ 
u(p,t)=\int_{{\bf{R}}^3}\, [
\int_{\lambda_1}^\infty\, 
e^{i\lambda t}\cdot d\theta(p,q,\lambda)\,\bigr]\cdot f(q)\, dq
\]
where
$\lambda\mapsto  \theta(p,q,\lambda)$ is a non-decreasing function on
$[\lambda_1,+\infty)$ for each fixed pair $p.q$.
An asymptotic expansion which recaptures
the $\theta$-function
will
be exposed in ¤ xx and
gives an illustration of Carleman's vigour in analysis.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A second example.}}
An early contribution by Carleman
is the article \emph{Sur le genere
du denominateur $D(\lambda)$
de Fredholm} [Arkiv fr matematik 1917].
Here one starts with a continuous function
$K(x,y)$ defined on the square
$\{0\leq x,y\leq 1\}$ which yields the
integral operator
\[
f\mapsto \mathcal K_f(x)= \int_0^1\, K(x,y)f(y)\, dy
\]
There  exists the discrete 
sequence of spectral values  $\{\lambda_\nu\}$ 
for which $E-\lambda_\nu \cdot \mathcal K_f$
are not invertible where
$E$ is the identity operator on the Hilbert space
$L^2[0,1]$.
Here $\{0< |\lambda_1|\leq |\lambda_2|\leq\ldots  \}$
are arranged with non-decreasing absolute values and
eventual
eigenspaces of diemension $e\geq 1$ means that the corresponding
$\lambda$-value is repated $e$ times in the sequence.
With these notations Carleman proved that
\[ 
\mathcal D(\lambda)=
e^{a\lambda}\cdot \prod_{\nu=1}^\infty\, 
\bigl(1-\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_\nu}\bigr)\tag{*}
\]
Here
$\mathcal D(\lambda)$ is the Fredholm resolvent defined for
each complex $\lambda$ by
the series
\[
1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\, \frac{(-1)^n}{n\, !}\cdot
\int_{[0,1]^n}\,
\text{det}(K_n(s_1,\dots,s_n))\, ds_1\cdots  ds_n
\]
where $K_n(s_1,\dots,s_n)$ is the $n\times n$-matrix with
elements
$\{K(s_i,s_k)\,\colon 1\leq i,k\leq n\}$.
A notable point is that (*) holds even when 
the kernel  function $K(x,y)$ is  not  symmetric
and (*) means that $\mathcal D(\lambda)$Êis an entire function whose order
in the sense of Hadamard is one.
The proof in the cited article gives
an excellent lesson about spectral properties of linear
operators where a crucial  point is to overcome
the lack of symmetry of 
$K(x,y)$. This was achieved by Carleman by analytic function theory
where 
a result  due to Arne Wiman plays a crucial role.
Recall that Wiman also was
professor at Uppsala during this time.
So Carleman's career started in a an "optimal enviroment"
guided by Holmgren and Wiman.

\centerline {\bf{About the contents.}}
\medskip


\noindent
Some familarity with basic results about 
linear operators and their spectra
is needed   
to follow the lecture. 
For the less experienced readers  we
insert  an  appendix 
about this classic material which  relies upon
Gustaf Neumann's constructions 
in his pioneering article about the Dirichlet problem from 
1877, together with  an application of Cauchy's integral formula in 
¤ A.6 which leads to
the operational calculs for
densely defined operators whose Neumann resolvents exist
in non-empty open subsets of the complex plane.
Since our main concern is to expose contributions by
Carleman, we include in ¤ A.8 
a proof of his  inequality for resolvent operators
from the article 
\emph{Zur Theorie der linearen Intergralgleichungen}
[Math. Zeitschrift 1921 ].
Since this result is not used in the spectral theorem
it is not necessary to pursue details of the 
rather involved proof
at a first instant.




\medskip


\noindent
Readers familiar with basic spectral theory can turn directly to ¤ 1
where
we  begin to study  operators
on Hilbert spaces. The first result  is
Hilbert's spectral theorem  for bounded self-adjoint operators,
including   spectral resolutions for
bounded normal operators. 
In ¤ 2 we expose  facts about densely defined unbouned
operators on Hilbert spaces where the construction of adjoints
plays a crucial  role.
After this we embark upon  material  in Carleman's cited monograph.
Here densely defined symmetric operators and 
conditions in order that they have self-adjoint extensions
are described in ¤ 3 and in the final part of
¤ 3 we 
construct
symmetrizations of linear operators
which are  used to analyze spectra of non-symmetric operators.
Finally ¤ 4-5  presents the "high points" which culminate in
the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
From a  historic point of view we recall
that Weyl already in 1910
considered  unbounded self-adjoint operators
which appear for densely defined ordinary differential operators.
See ¤ 3.4 for an example.
Extensive studies of spectra associated to ODE-operators
also occur in pionering articles by
Birkhoff's from the same time.
The "ugly example" in ¤ 5.3.1 discovered by Carleman in 1920
gave rise to
a general investigation about
self-adjoint extensions of densely defined and symmetric operators
on Hilbert spaces which
was carried out in his  cited monograph.
A crucial result in the spectral theory for unbounded
operators on Hilbert spaces goes as follows:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}
\emph{Let $T\colon \mathcal H\to  \mathcal H$
be
a densely defined operator whose graph
$\Gamma(T)=\{ (x,Tx)\,\}$
is closed in
$\mathcal H\times\mathcal H$.
Then the adjoint operator $T^*$ as well as the composed operator
$T^*T$ are densely defined
and every
vector $h\in \mathcal H$ has a unique representation}
\[
h=x+T^*(Tx)\quad\colon x\in \mathcal D(T^*T)
\] 
\emph{where the last space is contained in
$\mathcal D(T)$.}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
Special cases of the result above was
known by Weyl at an early stage and also in
Carleman's cited work when
$T$ is expressed by an integral operator.
A conclusive result - known as the polarisation  theorem -  due to F. Riesz and Nagy
shows that
with $T$ as above, there
exists a densely  defined and self-adjoint operator
$A$ such that
$A^2=T^*T$,
and $T$ can be expressed as
\[
T=P\circ A
\]
where $P$ is a bounded 
operator whose kernel is the
orthogonal complement of the range of 
$A$ while
\[
\langle P\circ A(x),
P\circ A(x)\rangle=\langle x,x\rangle \,\colon\,
x\in \mathcal D(A)
\]

\centerline {\bf{About the mathematics by Carleman.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
Personally I find that  few mathematical texts (if any)  superseed
Carleman's  fundamental   approach to many problems.
Several of his 
articles appear as veritable "classics"
which  merit a study  up to the present date.
We refrain from 
exposing   work by
Carleman devoted to  quasi-analytic functions and 
Bolzmann's kinetic gaz theory. But we 
present  some
results with proofs 
of a more self-contained character. 
The
material below is independent of the main topics in this lecture
and has been inserted
to illustrate the vigour in Carleman's work.
For the student intersted in analysis the proofs below are self-contained
which personlly think offer more  valuable lessons
compared to digesting "general theories". 
\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{¤ 0. An inversion formula.}}
A fundamental  result due to Abel gives an inversion formula for
the potential function
$U(x)$
in a conservative field of forces.
More precisely, let $U(x)$ be an even function of
$x$ with $U(0)=0$ and $x|to U(x)$ is stricitly increasing and convex
on $x\geq 0$.
A particle of unit mass which moves on
the real $x$-line satisfies Newton's equation
\[
\ddot x(t)=-U'(x(t))
\] 
where the initial conditions are $x(0)=0$ and $\dot x(0)= v>0$.
It follows that
\[
\frac{\dot x(t)^2}{2}+U(x(t))= \frac{v^2}{2}\implies
\]
\[
\dot x(t)=\sqrt{v^2-2U(x(t))}\tag{1}
\]
during a time interval $[0,T]$ where $\dot  x(t)>0$
when $0\leq t<T$ and
$\dot  x(T)=0$.
From (1) we get the equation
\[
T=\int_0^{x(T)}\, \frac{dx}{\sqrt{v^2-2U(x)}}\quad\colon\, 2\cdot U(x(T))=v^2
\]
With $U$ given this means that $T=T(v)$ is a function of $v$.
In a work from 1823, Abel established an inversion formula which
recaptures $U$ when the function
$v\mapsto T(v)$ is known.
The reader should consult the literature for this famous and
very
important result.
\medskip

\noindent
In the article \emph{Abelsche Intergalgleichung mot konstanten
Integralgrenzen}
[Mathematische Zeitschrift 1922], Carleman established
inversion formulas in Abel's spirit.
An example is as follows:
For every fixed real $0\leq x\leq 1$ 
\[ 
t\mapsto \log\,|x-t|
\]
is integrable on the unit interval $[0,1]$ and 
yields a bounded linear operator 
on the  Banach space $C^0[0,1]$
sending
every
$g\in C^0[0,1]$ to 
\[ 
T_g(x)= \int_0^1\, \log\,|x-t|\cdot g(t)\, dt
\]
It is not difficult to show that $T_g$ is injective.
It turns out that there is 
an inversion formula for the $T$-operator which
at the same time gives
a description of its range.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{0.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{With $f=T_g$
one has the inversion formula}
\[
\sqrt{x(1-x)}\cdot g(x)= \frac{1}{\pi^2}\cdot
\int_0^1\, 
\frac{f'(t)\cdot \sqrt{t(1-t)}}{x-t}\,dt+\frac{1}{\pi}\cdot \int_0^1\,g(t)\, dt\tag{*}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
This  inversion formula shows that 
a function 
$f$ in the range of $T$ must satisfy certain regularity properties. More precisely,
in (*) the first order derivative $f'(t)$ appears in an integral where we 
have taken a principal value.
Let us also remark that
one has the equation
\[
\int_0^1\,g(t)\, dt=-\frac{1}{2\pi\cdot \log 2}\cdot
\int_0^1\, \frac{f(x)}{\sqrt{(1-x)x}}\, dx\tag{**}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof of Theorem 0.1}.
The
complex log-function 
\[
z\mapsto \log\, z-t
\]
is defined when
$z\in {\bf{C}}\setminus (-\infty,1]$
for each $0\leq t\leq 1$. 
The single-valued branches are chosen so that
the argument of these  log-functions stay in $(-\pi,\pi)$
and  $\log x-t$ is real if $x>t$. It follows that
\[
\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\, \log (x+i\epsilon-t)=
 \log |x-t|+ \pi i\quad\colon x<t\tag{1}
 \]
where  the limit is taken as $\epsilon>0$ decrease to zero.
Let $g(t)$ be a continuous function on $[0,1]$ and
put
\[
 G(z)= \int_0^1\, \log(z-t)\cdot g(t)\, dt\tag{2}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A. Exercise.}} Show that  (1) gives:
\[
G(x+i0)=T_g(x)+\pi i\cdot \int_x^1\, g(t)\,dt \quad\colon 0< x<1\tag{i}
\]
where $G(x+i0)$ is the limit as $z=x+i\epsilon$ and $\epsilon>0$
decrease to zero.
Show in a similar way that
\[
G(x-i0)=T_g(x)-\pi i\cdot \int_x^1\, g(t)\,dt \quad\colon 0< x<1\tag{ii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Next, outside $[0,1]$
the complex derivative of $G$ becomes
\[ 
G'(z)=
\int_0^1\, \frac{g(t)}{z-t}\, dt
\]
Then (i-ii) give
\[
G'(x+i0)+G'(x-i0)= 2\cdot \frac{T_g(x)}{dx}
\quad\colon
\quad
G'(x+i0)-G'(x-i0)=-2\pi \cdot g(x)\tag{iii}
\]
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{B. The $\Phi$-function.}}
In ${\bf{C}}\setminus [0,1]$ we have
the analytic function $h(z)=\sqrt{z(z-1)}$
whose branch is chosen so that it is real and positive when
$z=x>1$. It follows that
\[
h(x+i0)=i\cdot \sqrt{x(1-x)}\quad\colon\quad
h(x-i0)=i\cdot \sqrt{x(1-x)}\quad\colon 0< x< 1 \tag{b.1}
\]
Consider the analytic function
\[
\Phi(z)=\sqrt{z(z-1)}\cdot G'(z)
\]
With $f=T_g$ we see
that (iii-iv) give the two equations

\[
\Phi(x+i0)+\Phi(x-i0)=2\pi\cdot \sqrt{x(1-x)}\cdot g(x)\tag{b.2}
\]
\[
\Phi(x+i0)-\Phi(x-i0)=2i\cdot f'(x)\cdot \sqrt{x(1-x)}\tag{b.3}
\]

\noindent
{\bf{C. The $\Psi$-function.}}
Set
\[
\Psi(z)=\int_0^1\, \frac{1}{z-t}\cdot
f'(t)\cdot \sqrt{t(1-t)}\,dt\tag{c.1}
\]
The equation (b.3)  and the general formula from ¤ XX give
\[
\Phi(x+i0)-\Phi(x-i0)=\Psi(x+i0)-\Psi(x-i0)\quad\colon\, 0<x<1\tag{c.2}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{D. Exercise.}}
Deduce from (c.2) that
\[ 
\Phi(z)= \Psi(z)+\int_0^1\,g(t)\, dt
\]
where the equality holds when
$z\in{\bf{C}}\setminus (-\infty,1]$.
Conclude from
the above that 
\[
2\pi\cdot \sqrt{x(1-x)}\cdot g(x)=\Psi(x+i0)+\Psi(x-i0)+2\cdot \int_0^1\,g(t)\, dt\tag{d.1}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Next, from (c.1 ) and the general formula in ¤ XX we have

\[
\Psi(x+i0)+\Psi(x-i0)=\frac{2}{\pi}\cdot 
\int_0^1\, 
\frac{f'(t)\cdot \sqrt{t(1-t)}}{x-t}\,dt\tag{d.2}
\]
where the last integral is taken as a principal value.
Together  (d.1-2)  give (*) in  Theorem 0.1.

\centerline{\bf{1. An approximation theorem.}}
\bigskip


\noindent
The result below was proved in
the article \emph{Sur un thorme de Weierstrass}
[Arkiv fr mathematik och fysik. vol 20 (1927]:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}
\emph{Let $f$ be a continuous and complex valued function on
the real $x$-line. To each $\epsilon>0$ there exists an
entire function $\phi(z)= \phi(x+iy)$
such that}
\[ 
\max_{x\in{\bf{R}}}\, |f(x)-\phi(x)|<\epsilon
\]



\medskip

\noindent
In the cited article Carleman gave an 
 elementary proof using Cauchys integral formula. But
his constructions can be extended to 
cover a more general situation which goes as follows.
Let $K$ be an unbounded  closed null\vvv set in ${\bf{C}}$.
If $0<R<R^*$ we put
\[
K[R,R^*]= K\cap \{ R\leq |z|\leq R^*\}
\]
and if  $R>0$ 
we put
$K\uuu R= K\cap \bar D\uuu R$ where
$\bar D\uuu R=\{|z|\leq R\}$.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{Suppose  there exists a strictly increasing sequence $\{R\uuu\nu\}$
where $R\uuu\nu\to +\infty$ such that 
${\bf{C}}\setminus K\uuu{R\uuu 1}$ and the sets}
\[ 
\Omega\uuu\nu={\bf{C}}\setminus \bar D\uuu {R\uuu \nu}\,\cup K[R\uuu\nu,
R\uuu{\nu+1}]
\] 
\emph{are connected for each $\nu\geq 1$.
Then every continuous function on $K$ can be uniformly approximated by entire functions.}
\bigskip


\noindent
To prove this result we first establish the following.

\medskip

\noindent {\bf{1.2 Lemma.}}
\emph{Consider some $\nu\geq 1$
a continuous function
$\psi$  on 
$S= \bar D\uuu{R\uuu n}\cup\, K[R\uuu \nu,R\uuu{\nu+1}]$
where $\psi$ is analytic in the open disc $D\uuu{R\uuu\nu}$.
Then $\psi$ can be uniformly approximated on $S$ by polynomials in $z$.}

\medskip

\noindent 
\emph{Proof}.
If 
we have found a sequence of polynomials
$\{p\uuu k\}$ which approximate $\psi$ uniformly on
$S\uuu *=\{|z|=R\uuu\nu\}\cup K[R\uuu \nu,R\uuu{\nu+1}]$
then this sequence approximates $\psi$ on $S$. In fact, this follows since
$\psi$ is analytic in the disc $D\uuu{R\uuu \nu}$
so by the maximum principle for analytic functions in a disc
we have
\[
||p\uuu k\vvv\psi||\uuu S=
||p\uuu k\vvv\psi||\uuu {S\uuu *}
\] 
for each $k$.
Next, if uniform approximation on $S\uuu *$ fails
there exists a Riesz\vvv measure $\mu$ supported by
$S\uuu *$ which is $\perp$ to all analytic polynomials while
\[
\int\, \psi\cdot d\mu\neq 0\tag{1}
\]
To see that this cannot occur we consider the Cauchy transform
\[
\mathcal C(z)=\int\, \frac{d\mu(\zeta)}{z\vvv\zeta}
\]
Since $\int\, \zeta^n\cdot d\mu(\zeta)=0$ for every $n\geq 0$
we see that $\mathcal C(z)=0$ in the exterior disc
$|z|> R\uuu{\nu+1}$.
The connectivity hypothesis implies that
$\mathcal C(z)=0$ in the whole open complement of $S$.
Now $K$ was a null set which means that the
$L^1\uuu{\text{loc}}$\vvv function 
$\mathcal C(z)$ is zero in the exterior disc
$|z|>R\uuu\nu$ and hence its distribution derivative
$\bar\partial(\mathcal C\uuu\nu)$ also vanishes in this exterior disc.
At the same time we have the equality
\[ \bar\partial(C\uuu\nu)= \mu
\]
We conclude that the support of $\mu$ is confined to the circle
$\{|z|=R\uuu\nu\}$.
But then (1) cannot hold since
the restriction of $\psi$ to
this circle by assumption extends to be analytic in the disc
$D\uuu {R\uuu\nu}$ and therefore can be uniformly approximated by
polynomials on the circle.

\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof of Theorem A.2.}
Let $\epsilon>0$ and
$\{\alpha\uuu \nu\}$ is a sequence of positive numbers such that
$\sum\,\alpha\uuu\nu<\epsilon$.
Consider some $f\in C^0(K)$. Starting with the set
$K\uuu{R\uuu 1}$
we use the assumption that its complement is connected
and using   Cauchy transforms as in  Lemma A.3
one shows that the restriction of $f$ to this compact set
can be uniformly approximated by polynomials. So we find
$P\uuu 1(z)$ such that
\[
||P\uuu 1\vvv f||\uuu {K\uuu{R\uuu 1}}<\alpha\uuu 1\tag{i}
\]
From (i) one easily construct a continuous function
$\psi$ on $\bar D\uuu{R\uuu 1}\cup K[R\uuu 1,R\uuu 2]$
such that
$\psi=P\uuu1 $ holds in the disc
$\bar D\uuu{R\uuu 1}$ and
the maximum norm
\[
||\psi\vvv f||\uuu { K[R\uuu 1,R\uuu 2]}\leq \alpha\uuu 1
\]
Lemma A.3 gives a polynomial $P\uuu 2$ such that
\[
||P\uuu 2\vvv P\uuu 1||\uuu {D\uuu{R\uuu 1}}<\alpha\uuu 2
\quad\text{and}\quad 
||P\uuu 2\vvv f||\uuu {K[R\uuu 1,R\uuu 2]}\leq
\alpha\uuu 1+\alpha\uuu 2
\]
Repeat the construction where Lemma A.3 is used as $\nu$ increases.
This gives
a sequence of polynomials $\{P\uuu\nu\}$
such that
\[
||P\uuu \nu \vvv P\uuu {\nu\vvv 1}||\uuu {D\uuu{R\uuu \nu }}<\alpha\uuu \nu
\quad\text{and}\quad 
||P\uuu\nu\vvv f||\uuu {K[R\uuu {\nu\vvv 1},R\uuu \nu]}<
\alpha\uuu 1+\ldots+\alpha\uuu\nu
\]
hold for all $\nu$.
From this it is easily seen that we obtain an entire function
\[ 
P^*(z)= P\uuu 1(z)+\sum\uuu{\nu=1}^\infty
P\uuu{\nu+1}(z)\vvv P\uuu\nu(z)
\]
Finally the reader can check that the inequalities above imply that
the maximum norm
\[
 ||P^*\vvv f||\uuu K\leq \alpha\uuu 1+ \sum\uuu{\nu=1}^\infty\,\alpha\uuu\nu
\]
Since the last sum is $\leq 2\epsilon$ and $\epsilon>0$ was arbitrary
we have proved Theorem A.3.

\noindent
{\bf 1.3 Exercise.}
Use similar methods as above to show that if
$f(z)$ is analytic in the upper half plane
$U^+=\mathfrak{Im}(z)>0$
and has continuous boundary values on the real line, then
$f$ can be uniformly approximated by an entire function, i.e. to
every $\epsilon>0$ there exists an entire function
$F(z)$ such that
\[
\max_{z\in U^+}\, |F(z)-f(z)|\leq\epsilon

\centerline {\bf{2. An inequality for differentiable functions.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
A fundamental result 
was proved by Carleman in 
the article \emph{Sur un thorme de M. Denjoy}
[C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris 1922]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{There exists an absolute constant $\mathcal C$
such that the inequality below holds
for every pair $(f,n)$, where $n$ is a positive integer
and $f$
a non-negative real-valued $C^\infty$- function 
defined on  the closed unit interval $[0,1]$
whose  derivatives up to order $n$ vanish at the
two end points.}
\[
\sum_{\nu=1}^{\nu=n}\,
\,\frac{1}{[\beta_\nu]^{\frac{1}{\nu}}}\leq
\mathcal C\cdot\int_0^1\,f(x)dx\quad\colon\quad
\beta_\nu=\sqrt{\int_0^1\, [f^{(\nu)}(x)]^2\cdot dx}\tag{*}
\]

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
The proof below shows that one can take
\[ 
C\leq 2e\pi\cdot  (1+
\frac{1}{4\pi^2 e^2-1})\tag{*}
\]
The best constant $\mathcal C_*$ which would give
\[
\sum_{p=1}^{p=n}\,
\frac{1}{\beta_p(f)}\leq\mathcal C^*\tag{i}
\]
for all $n$ and every $f\in\mathcal S_n$ is not known.
Let us also remarkl that 
the inequality (*)
is sharp in the sense that there exists a constant $C_*$
such that  for every $n\geq 2$ there exists a 
function $f_n(x)$ as above so that 
the opposed inequality
(*) holds with $C_*$. Hence
(*) 
demonstrates
that the standard cut-off  functions which are used
in  many applications 
to keep maximum norms of derivatives small up to
order $n$ small, are optimal up to a constant.
So the theoretical result in (*)
plays 
a role in numerical analysis where one often uses smoothing
methods.
The  proof  of (*) 
employs
estimates for harmonic measures
applied to the subharmonic Log-function of the absolute value of the
Laplace transform of $f$, i.e. via a "detour into the complex domain"
which in 1922 appeared as a  "revolutionary method".

\bigskip
 
\centerline{\emph{Proof of Theorem 2.1}.}
\medskip


\noindent
Let $n\geq 1$ and 
keeping $f$ fixed we put $\beta_p=\beta_p(f)$
to simplify notations. 
Using partial integrations and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality 
one shows that the
$\beta$-numbers are non-decreasing. i.e. 
\[ 
1=\beta_0\leq\beta_1\leq \ldots\leq \beta_{n+1}\tag{*}
\]
Define the complex Laplace transform
\[ 
\Phi(z)=\int_0^1\, e^{-zt}f(t) dt
\]
Since $f$ by assumption is $n$-flat at the end-ponts, 
integration by parts $p$ times  gives:
\[
 \Phi(z)=z^{-p}\int_0^1\, e^{-zt}\cdot \partial^p(f^2)(t) dt\quad\colon\quad 1\leq p\leq n+1
\]
where
$\partial^p(f^2)$ is the derivative of order $p$ of $f^2$.
We have
\[
\partial^p(f^2)=\sum_{\nu=0}^{\nu=p}\, \binom  {p}{\nu}\cdot
f^{(\nu)}\cdot f^{(p-\nu)}\quad\colon\,
1\leq p\leq n+1 \tag{1}
\]
Now we  study the absolute value of $\Phi$ on the vertical
line $\mathfrak{Re}(z)=-1$. 
Since $|e^{t-iyt}|= e^t$
for all $y$, the triangle inequality gives
\[ 
|-1+iy|^p\cdot |\Phi(-1+iy)|\leq
\sum_{\nu=0}^{\nu=p}\, \binom  {p}{\nu}\cdot
\int_0^1\, e^t\cdot |f^{(\nu)}(t)|\cdot |f^{(p-\nu)}(t)|\cdot dt\tag{2}
\]
Since  $e^t\leq e$ on $[0,1]$, the 
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and 
the definition of the $\beta$-numbers give:
\[
|-1+iy|^p\cdot |\Phi(-1+iy)|\leq e\cdot 
\sum_{\nu=0}^{\nu=p}\, \binom  {p}{\nu}\cdot
\beta_\nu^\nu\cdot \beta_{p-\nu}^{p-\nu}\tag{3}
\]
From (*) it follows that
$\beta_\nu^\nu\cdot \beta_{p-\nu}^{p-\nu}\leq \beta_p^p$
for each $\nu$ and since
$\sum_{\nu=0}^{\nu=p}\, \binom  {p}{\nu}=2^p$ we obtain
\[
|-1+iy|^p\cdot |\Phi(-1+iy)|\leq e\cdot 2^p\cdot \beta_p^p\tag{4}
\]
Passing to the logarithm we get
\[
\log\, |\Phi(-1+iy)|\leq 1+p\cdot \log\,\frac{2\beta_p}{|-1+iy|}\tag{5}
\]
Here (5) holds when $1\leq p\leq n+1$ and 
the assumption that $\beta_0=1$ also gives
\[
\log\, |\Phi(-1+iy)|\leq 1\tag{6}
\]

\noindent
{\bf{The $\omega$-function}}.
To each $1\leq p\leq n+1$
we find a positve number $y_p$ such that
\[
|-1+iy_p|=2e\beta_p
\]
Now we define a function $\omega(y)$ where
$\omega(y)=0$ when $y<y_1$ and
\[
\omega(y)=p\quad\colon\quad y_p\leq y<y_{p+1}
\]
and finally $\omega(y)=n+1$ when $y\geq y_{n+1}$.
Then (5-6) give
the inequality
\[
\log\,|\phi(-1+iy)|\leq 1-\omega(y)
\quad\colon\,-\infty<y<+\infty
\tag{7}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
\emph { A harmonic majorisation.}
With $1-\omega(y)$ as boundary function in the half-plane
$\mathfrak{Re}(z)>-1$
we construct the harmonic extension $H(z)$
which by
Poisson's formula is given by:
\[ 
H(0)=
\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, \frac{1-\omega(y)}{1+y^2}\cdot dy
\]
Now  $\log\,|\Phi(z)|$ is subharmonic in this half-plane and hence
(7) gives:
\[
0=\log|\Phi(0)|\leq H(0)
\]
We conclude that
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, \frac{\omega(y)}{1+y^2}\cdot dy
\leq \pi\tag{8}
\]
Since  $\omega(y)=0$ when $y\leq y_1$ we see that
(8) gives the inequality
\[
\int_{y_1}^\infty\, \frac{\omega(y)}{y^2}\cdot dy
\leq \frac{y_1^2}{1+y_1^2}\cdot \pi\tag{9}
\]
The construction of the $\omega$-function gives the equation 
\[
\int_{y_1}^\infty\, \frac{\omega(y)}{y^2}\cdot dy
=\frac{1}{y_1}+\ldots+\frac{1}{y_{n+1}}\tag{10}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Next, the construction of the $y_p$-numbers entail that
$y_p\leq 2e\beta_p$ so (9-10) 
give
\[
\frac{1}{\beta_1}+\ldots+\frac{1}{\beta_{n+1}}\leq
2e\pi\cdot  
\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{y_1^2}}\tag{11}
\]

\noindent
Finally, we have $1+y_1^2=4e^2\beta_1^2$ and 
recall that Writinger's inequality
implies that $\beta_1\geq \pi$. Hence
\[
\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{y_1^2}}\leq
1+\frac{1}{4\pi^2e^2-1}\tag{12}
\]
and then (11-12) give the requested inequality in Theorem 2.1.

\centerline {\bf {3. An inequality for
inverse Fourier transforms in $ L^2({\bf{R^+}})$.}}
\medskip

\noindent 
By Parsevel's theorem the Fourier transform sends $L^2$-functions 
on the $\xi$-line to $L^2$-functions on the $x$-line.
Now one can seek the class of non-negative $L^2$-functions $\phi(x)$
such that there exists
an $L^2$-function $F(\xi)$ supported by the half-line  $\xi\geq 0$ and
\[ 
\phi(x)=\bigl|\,\int_0^ \infty\,
e^{ix\xi}\cdot F(\xi)\cdot d\xi\bigr|\tag{*}
\]


\noindent
The theorem  below was proved in [Carleman] which 
apart from  applications  to 
quasi-analytic functions    has several
other consequences which are put forward by
Paley and Wiener in their text-book
[Pa-Wi]. Carleman's
proof  
employs a detour in the complex domain
where   Jensen's formula plays a crucial role.
Here is the result:

\bigskip



\noindent
{\bf 3.1 Theorem. } \emph{An $L^2$-function $\phi(x)$
satisfies (*) if and only if}
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, \log^+\bigl [\,\frac{1}{\phi(x)}\,\bigr ]
\cdot \frac{dx}{1+x^2}<\infty\tag{i}
\]
\emph{Moreover, when (*) holds and
$F(\xi)$ satisfies the 
weighted mean-value equality}
\[ 
\int_0^\infty\, F(\xi)\cdot e^{-\xi}\ d\xi=1\tag{ii}
\]
then 
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, \log^+\bigl [\,\frac{1}{\phi(x)}\,\bigr ]
\cdot \frac{dx}{1+x^2}\leq 
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, \frac{\phi(x)^2}{1+x^2}\cdot dx\tag{iii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
First we prove the suffiency.
Let  $\phi(x)$ be  a non-negative  $L^2$-function where the  integral  
(i)  is finite.
The harmonic extension of
$\log\,\phi(x)$ to the upper half-plane is given by:
\[
\lambda(x+iy)=\frac{y}{\pi}\cdot 
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, \frac{\log\,\,\phi(t)}{(x-t)^2+y^2}\cdot dt
\quad\colon\, y>0\tag{1}
\]


\noindent Let $\mu(z)$ be the conjugate harmonic function of
$\lambda$ and set
\[
h(z)=e^{\lambda(z)+i\mu(z)}\tag{2}
\]


\noindent
Fatou's theorem gives  for almost every $x$ 
a limit
\[
\lim_{y\to 0}\,\lambda(x+iy)=\log\,\,\phi(x)\tag{3}
\]
Or, equivalently
\[
\lim_{y\to 0}\,|h(x+iy)|=\phi(x)\tag{4}
\]


\noindent
From (1) and the fact that the geometric mean value of positive numbers
cannot exceed their arithmetic mean value, one has
\[
\bigl |h(x+iy)\,\bigr |= e^{\lambda(x+iy)}\leq\frac{y}{\pi}\cdot
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, \frac{\phi(t)}{(x-t)^2+y^2}\cdot dt
\quad\colon\, y>0\tag{5}
\]


\noindent
Then (5) the Schwarz inequality give:
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, \bigl |h(x+iy)\,\bigr |^2\,dx\leq
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, \bigl |\phi(x)\,\bigr |^2\,dx\quad\colon\, y>0\tag{6}
\]
Here  $h(z)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane
so that (6) and Cauchy's formula entail that
if $\xi<0$, then the integrals
\[
 J(y)=
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\, h(x+iy)\cdot e^{-ix\xi+y\xi}\cdot dx\quad\colon\ y>0\tag{7}
\]
are independent of $y$. Passing to the limit as $y\to\infty$ and 
using the uniform upper bounds on the $L^2$-norms of 
the functions $h_y(x)\mapsto h(x+iy)$,
it follows that $J(y)$ vanishes identically.
So the Fourier transforms of
$h_y(x)$ are supported by $\xi\geq 0$ for all $y>0$.
Passing to the limit as $y\to 0$ the same holds for
the Fourier transform of $h(x)$. Finally (4) gives
\[
\phi(x)=|h(x)|\tag{8}
\]
By Parseval's theorem
$\widehat h(\xi)$ is an $L^2$-function and hence
$\phi(x)$ has  the requested form (*).


\medskip







\noindent
{\emph{Necessity.}
Since $F$ is in $L^2$ there exists the Plancherel limit
\[ 
\psi(x)=\lim_{N\to\infty}
\,\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot\int_0^N\,
e^{ix\xi}\cdot F(\xi)\, d\xi\,\tag{9}
\]
and in
the upper half plane we  get the analytic function
\[ 
\psi(x+iy)=
\,\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot\int_0^\infty\,
e^{ix\xi -y\xi}\cdot F(\xi)\, d\xi\tag{10}
\]



\noindent
Suppose that  $F(\xi)$ satisfies (ii) in the  Theorem which gives
\[ 
\psi(i)=1
\]
Consider the conformal map from the upper half-plane into the unit disc where
\[ 
w=\frac{z-i}{z+i}
\]
Here  $\psi(x)$ corresponds to a function
$\Phi(e^{is})$ on the unit circe $|w|=1$ and:
\[ 
\int_{-\pi}^\pi\, |\Phi(e^{is})|^2 \, ds=
2\cdot\int_{-\infty}^\infty\,\frac{|\phi(x)|^2}{1+x^2}\, dx\tag{11}
\]


\noindent
Similarly let $\Psi(w)$ be the analytic function in
$|w|<1$ which corresponds to $\psi(z)$. From (10-11)  it follows that
$\Psi(w)$ is the Poisson extension of $\Phi$, i.e.
\[ 
\Psi(w)=
\frac{1}{2\pi}\
\int_{-\pi}^\pi\, \,\frac{1-|w|^2}{
|e^{is}-w|^2}\cdot \Phi(e^{is})\cdot ds\tag{12}
\]
If $0<r<1$ it follows that
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi}\
\int_{-\pi}^\pi\, \log^+\,|\Psi(re^{is}|\cdot ds\leq
\frac{1}{2\pi}\
\int_{-\pi}^\pi\, \bigl |\Psi(re^{is}\bigr |^2\cdot ds\leq
\frac{1}{2\pi}\
\int_{-\pi}^\pi\, \Phi(e^{is}|^2\cdot ds\tag{13}
\]


\noindent 
Now  (12) gives:
\[
\lim_{r\to 1}\,\Psi(re^{is})=\Phi(e^{is})\quad\colon\,
\text{almost everywhere}\quad 0\leq s\leq 2\pi\tag{14}
\]


\noindent 
Next, since
$\psi(i)=1$ we have  $\Psi(0)=1$ which
gives the inequality
\[
\int_{-\pi}^\pi\, \log^+\frac{1}{\,|\Psi(re^{is}|}\cdot ds\leq
\int_{-\pi}^\pi\, \log^+\,|\Psi(re^{is}|\cdot ds\quad\colon 0<r<1\tag{15}
\]


\noindent
By (13-15) a passage to the limit as $r\to 1$ gives
\[
\int_{-\pi}^\pi\, \log^+\frac{1}{\,|\Phi(e^{is}|}\cdot ds\leq
\int_{-\pi}^\pi\, \bigl |\,\Phi(e^{is}\bigr |^2\cdot ds\tag{16}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Returning to the real $x$-line  the inequality (iii) follows 
which at the same time finishes the proof of the theorem.

\centerline {\bf{4. The Bergman kernel.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded and simply
connected domain in ${\bf{C}}$.
If $a\in\Omega$ a famous result due to Stefan Bergman
gives  the conformal mapping
function $f_a\colon \Omega\to D$
via the kernel function of the Hilbert space
$H^2(\Omega)$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A. Bergman's  Theorem.}}
\emph{The conformal map $f_a$ is given by}
\[ 
f_a(z)= \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{K(a,a)}}
\cdot \int_a^z\, K(z,a)\, dz
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Next, the  Gram-Schmidt construction gives
an orthonormal basis $\{P_n(z)\}$
in $H^2(\Omega)$
where  $P_n$ has degree $n$ and
\[ 
\iint_\Omega \, P_k\cdot \bar P_m\cdot dxdy=
\text{Kronecker's delta function}
\]
From Bergman's result  one
expects that these polynomials are related to
a conformal mapping function.
We shall consider the case
when
$\Omega$ is a Jordan domain whose boundary
curve
$\Gamma$ is \emph{real-analytic}.
Let $\phi$
be the conformal map
from the \emph{exterior domain}
$\Omega^*=\Sigma\setminus\bar\Omega$ onto
the exterior disc $|z|>1$.
Here $\phi$ is normalised so that it maps the point at infinity
into itself.
The inverse conformal mapping function
$\psi$   is defined in $|z|>1$ and has a series expansion
\[ 
\psi(z)=\tau\cdot z+ \tau_0+\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty\, \tau_\nu\cdot
\frac{1}{z^\nu}\tag{*}
\]
where $\tau$ is a positive real number.
The assumption that $\Gamma$ is real-analytic gives
some $\rho_1<1$ such that
$\psi$ extends to a conformal map from the
exterior disc $|z|>\rho_1$ onto a domain whose compact
complement is contained in $\Omega$.
\medskip

\noindent
It turns out that the polynomials $\{P_ n\}$
are  approximated 
by functions expressed by
$\phi$ and is complex derivative
on $\partial\Omega$.
Inspired by Faber's article \emph{ber Tschebyscheffsche
Polynome} [Crelle. J. 1920], Carleman
proved an asymptotic result  in
the article \emph{ber die approximation analytischer funktionen
durch linearen aggregaten von vorgegebenen potenzen} [Arkiv fr matematik och fysik. 1920].
\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{B. Theorem.}}
\emph{There exists a constant $C$ which depends upon $\Omega$ only
such that to every
$n\geq 1$ there is an analytic  function $\omega_n(z)$ defined in
$\Omega^*$ and}
\[
 P_n(z)=
 \sqrt{\frac{n+1}{\pi}}
 \cdot \phi'(z)\cdot \phi(z)^n\cdot
 \bigl(1+\omega_n(z)\bigr)
 \quad\colon z\in \partial \Omega
 \]
\emph{where }
\[ 
\max_{z\in\partial \Omega}\,\, |\omega_n(z)|\leq
C\cdot \sqrt{n}\cdot \rho_1^n\quad\colon\quad n=1,2,\ldots
\]

\medskip



\centerline {\emph{Proof.}}
\medskip


\noindent
For each $n\geq 2$ we denote by $\mathcal M_n$ the space of monic polynomials
of degree $n$:
\[ 
Q(z)= z^n+b_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\ldots +b_0
\]
Put 
\[ 
I(Q)=  \iint_ \Omega\, |Q(z)|^2\,  dxdy
\]
and with $n$ kept fixed we set 
\[ 
I_ *(n)=\min_{Q\in \mathcal M_n} \,I(Q)
\]
To each $Q$ we introduce the
primitive polynomial 
\[ 
\widehat{Q}(z)=\frac{z^{n+1}}{n+1}+ \frac{b_ {n-1}}{n}z^n+\ldots+b_0z
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1. Exercise.}} Use Green's formula to show that
\[
I(Q)=\frac{1}{4}\int_ {\partial \Omega}\, |\partial_ n(\widehat{Q})|^2\, ds
\] 
where $ds$ is the arc-length measure on $\partial\Omega$
and we have taken the outer normal derivative of
$\widehat{Q}$.
Next,  take the inverse conformal  map $\psi(\zeta)$ in (*) and set
\[ 
F(\zeta)= \widehat{Q}(\psi(\zeta))
\]
Then $F$ is analytic in the exterior disc $|\zeta|>1$
and by (*) above,
$F$ has a series expansion
\[
F(\zeta)=\tau^{n+1}\bigl[ \frac{\zeta^{n+1}}{n+1}+
A_n\zeta^n+\ldots+A_ 1\zeta+A_ 0+
\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty\, \alpha_\nu\cdot \zeta^{-\nu}\bigr]\tag{1.1}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{2. Exercise.}}
Use a variable substitution via $\psi$ to show that
\[
I(Q)= \int_ {|\zeta|= 1}\, \frac{d}{dr}( |F(e^{i\theta})|^2)\, d\theta
\]
Show also that  the series expansion (1.1) identifies 
the right hand side with
\[ 
\pi\cdot \tau^{2n+2}\cdot [\frac{1}{n+1}+ \sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\,
k\cdot |A_k|^2-
\sum_{\\nu=1}^\infty\, \nu\cdot |\alpha_\nu|^2\,\bigr]\tag{2.1}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{3. An upper bound for $I_ *(n)$}}.
In (2.1) the coefficients $A_ 1,\ldots,A_ n$ are determined via $Q$
and
the reader may verify that there exists  $Q\in\mathcal M_n$
such that
$A_ 1=\ldots=A_ n=0$.
It follows that
\[
I_ *(n)\leq \pi\cdot \tau^{2n+2}\cdot [\frac{1}{n+1}
-
\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty\, \nu\cdot |\alpha_\nu|^2\,\bigr]
\leq \pi\cdot \tau^{2n+2}\cdot \frac{1}{n+1}\tag{3.1}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{4. A lower bound for $I_ *$}}.
The upper bound (3.1) did not use that
$\partial\Omega$ is real- analytic, i.e. (3.1)  is valid for
every Jordan domain whose boundary curve is of class $C^1$.
To get a lower bound we use the constant $\rho-1<1$ from the above
and choose  $\rho_ 1<\rho<1$. Now
$\psi$
maps the exterior disc
$|\zeta|>\rho$ conformally to an exterior domain
$U^*=\Sigma\setminus \bar U$ where $U$  is a relatively compact
Jordan  domain inside $\Omega$.
Choose  $Q_n\in\mathcal M_n$
so that
\[
I(Q_n)=I_ *(n)
\]
Since  $\Omega\setminus \bar U\subset \Omega$  we have
\[
I_*> \iint_{\Omega\setminus \bar U}\,|Q_n(z)|^2\, dxdx\tag{4.1}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{5. Exercise.}}
Show that (4.1)  is equal to
\[
\int_ {|\zeta|= 1}\, \frac{d}{dr}( |F(e^{i\theta})|^2\cdot d\theta
-
\int_ {|\zeta|= \rho}\, \frac{d}{dr}( |F(e^{i\theta})|^2\cdot \rho\cdot d\theta=
\]
\[
\pi\cdot \tau^{2n+2}\cdot 
[\frac{1- \rho^{2n+2}}{n+1}+ 
\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\,
k\cdot |A_ k|^2\cdot (1- \rho^{2\nu})+
\sum_{\\nu=1}^\infty\, \nu\cdot |\alpha_\nu|^2
\cdot (\frac{1}{\rho^{2\nu}}-1)\,\bigr]
\]
\medskip

\noindent
and conclude that
one has the
lower bound
\[ 
I_ *(n)\geq\frac{\pi}{n+1}\cdot \tau^{2n+2}\cdot (1- \rho^{2n+2})
\tag{5.1}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Together (4.1) and (5.1)
give the inequality
\[
\sum_ {k=1}^{k=n}\,
k\cdot |A_ k|^2\cdot (1- \rho^{2\nu})+
\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty\, \nu\cdot |\alpha_\nu|^2
\cdot (\frac{1}{\rho^{2\nu}}- 1)\,\leq \frac{\pi}{n+1}\cdot \rho^{2n+2}\tag{5.2}
\]
Since $1- \rho^2\leq 1- \rho^{2\nu}$ for every $\nu\geq 1$
it follows that
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\,
k\cdot |A_ k|^2+
\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty\, \nu\cdot |\alpha_\nu|^2\leq
\frac{\pi}{(1-\rho^2)\cdot n+1}\cdot \rho^{2n+2}\tag{5.3}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{6. Conclusion.}}
Recall that $F(\zeta)= \widehat{Q_n}(\psi(\zeta)$.
So after a derivation 
we get
\[ 
F'(\zeta)= \psi'(\zeta)\cdot Q_n(\psi(\zeta))
\]
Hence the series expansion  of $F(\zeta)$ gives
\[
Q_n(\psi(\zeta))=
\frac{\tau^{n+1}}{\psi'(\zeta)}\cdot \bigl[
\zeta^n+
\sum_ {k=1}^{k=n}\, k\cdot A_ k\zeta^{k- 1}
+\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty \, \nu\cdot \alpha_\nu \cdot \zeta^{- \nu- 1}\,\bigr]\tag{6.1}
\]
where the equality holds for $|\zeta|>\rho$.
Put

\[
\omega^*(\zeta)=
\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\, k\cdot A_ k\zeta^{k- 1}
+\sum_ {\nu=1}^\infty \, \nu\cdot \alpha_\nu \cdot \zeta^{-\nu- 1}
\]
When $|\zeta|=1$ the triangle inequality gives
\[
|\omega^*(\zeta)|\leq
\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\, k\cdot |A_ k|
+\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty \, \nu\cdot |\alpha_\nu| \tag{6.2}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{7. Exercise.}}
Notice  that (5.3) holds for every $ \rho>\rho_ 1$
and use this together with suitable Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities to show that
(6.1)  gives a constant $C$ which is independent of $n$ such that
\[
|\omega^*(\zeta)|\leq C\cdot  \sqrt{n}\cdot \rho_ 1^{n+1}\tag{7.1}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Final part of the proof.}
Since $\psi$ is the inverse of $\phi$ we have
\[
\psi'(\phi(z))\cdot Q_n(\psi(\phi(z)= \frac{Q_n(z)}{\phi'(z)}
\]
Define the function  on $\partial\Omega$ by
 \[
\omega_ n(z)=\frac{\omega^*(\phi(z))}{\phi'(z)}\tag{i}
\]
Then (6.2) gives
\[
Q_n(z)= \tau^{n+1}\cdot \phi'(z)\cdot [\phi(z)^n+\omega_n(z)\,\bigr]\tag{ii}
\]
where Exercise 7 shows that $|\omega_ n(z)|$ satisfies the estimate in
Theorem 2.
Finally, the polynomial $Q_n$ minimized the $L^2$-norm
under the constraint  that the leading term is $z^n$ and for this variational problem
the upper and the lower bounds in (4.1-5.1) imply that
\[ 
|I_ *(n)-\frac{\pi}{n+1}\cdot \tau^{2n+2}|\leq 
\frac{\pi}{n+1}\cdot \tau^{2n+2}\cdot \rho^{2n+2}
\]
If we normalise $Q_n$ so that its $L^2$-norm is one gets a
polynomial $P_ n(z)$ where 
the factor $\tau^{n+1}$
is replaced by
$\frac{\sqrt{n+1}}{\sqrt{\pi}}$ which finishes the proof of
Theorem B.

\centerline {\bf{5. Partial sums of Fourier series.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function on
$0\leq x\leq 2\pi$ with $f(0)= f(2\pi)$  and consider the 
Fourier series
\[ 
f(x)=\frac{a_ 0}{2}+ \sum\, a_ k\cdot \cos kx+\sum\, b_ k\cdot \sin kx
\]
Gibbs gave examples which  show that
the partial sums 
\[ 
s_n(x)=\frac{a_ 0}{2}+ \sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\, a_ k\cdot \cos kx+\sum\, b_ k\cdot \sin kx
\]
can fail to converge to $f(x)$ for certain
$x$-values.
To analyze the situation
we introduce
the maximum norms
\[ 
\rho_f(n)= \max_{0\leq x\leq 2\pi}\, |s_n(x)-f(x)|\quad\colon n=1,2,\ldots
\]
In general they behave in an  irregular fashion as $n\to+\infty$ and 
Hardy constructed examples of continuous functions
$f$ such that
\[
\limsup_{n\to \infty}\, \rho_f(n)=+\infty
\]
This led Carleman to study
the behaviour in the mean. For each $n\geq 1$ we set
\[
\mathcal C_n(f)= \sqrt{\frac{1}{n+1}\cdot
\sum_{\nu=0}^{\nu=n}\, \rho_f(\nu)^2}
\]
Next, put
\[ 
\omega_f(\delta)= \max_{x,y}\, |f(x)-f(y)|\,\colon |x-y|\leq \delta
\]
Since $f$ is uniformly continuous 
$\omega_f(\delta)\to 0$ as $\delta\to 0$.
The following result is proved in the article 
\emph{A theorem concerninig Fourier series}
[London math.soc. 1923]:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{5.1 Theorem}}. \emph{There exists an absolute constant $K$
such that the following hold for every
continuous function $f$ with maximum norm
$\leq 1$:}
\[ 
\mathcal D_n(f)\leq K\cdot \bigl[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\omega_f(\frac{1}{n})\bigr]
\quad\colon\, n=1,2,\ldots
\]
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
This result   shows that
Gibbs'  phenomenon for a given continuous function
$f$ only arises for a sparse sequence of $n$-values.
In the  joint article \emph{Fourier's series and analytic functions}
[Proc. of the Royal Soc. 1923] 
with Hardy,  pointwise convergence was
studied where the limit is unrestricted as $n\to \infty$.
However, these results were rather incomplete and it was not until
1965 when Lennart Carleson proved that
for every continuous function $f(x)$ there exists
a null set $\mathcal N$ in $[0,2\pi]$ such that
\[
\lim_{n\to \infty}\, s_n(x)=f(x) \quad\colon\, x\in [0,2\pi]\setminus
\mathcal N\tag{*}
\]
Carleson's  result  constitutes one of the greatest achievements ever in
mathematical analysis  and we shall not try to
enter details of the proof.
Recall that Carleson also proved
the almost everywhere convergence
when $f\in L^2[0,2\pi]$.
When    pointwise convergence holds 
in  (*)  is  obvious that
\[
\lim_{n\to \infty}  \sqrt{\frac{1}{n+1}\cdot
\sum_{\nu=0}^{\nu=n}\, |s_n(x)-f(x)|^2}=0\tag{**}
\]
Here (**) is much  weaker than (*). On the other hand, the null-set
which appears in (*) for a given $L^2$-function $f$ 
is in general strictly larger than
the set of Lebesgue points for $f$, i.e. those $x$ for which
\[
f(x)=\lim_{\delta\to 0}\,
\frac{1}{2\delta}\cdot  \int_{x-\delta}^{x+\delta}\,
|f(s)-f(x)|\, ds=0
\]
In the cited article from 1922, Carleman   proved that
 (**) holds for
every Lebesgue point of the $L^2$-functionÊ$f$
which for "ugly Lebegue points" which belong  to 
$\mathcal N$ gives an averaged substitute to Carleson's
result.
Carleman's  proof of the theorem above 
employs some special estimates   of the Dini kernel
which have independent interest.

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{5.2 A convergence result for
$L^2$-functions.}}
Let $f(x)$ be a real\vvv valued and square integrable function
on $(\vvv \pi,\pi)$, i.e.
\[
\int\uuu{\vvv\pi}^\pi\, |f(x)|^2\, dx<\infty
\]
We say that
$f$ has a determined value $A=f(0)$ at $x=0$ if the following two conditions hold:
\[
\lim\uuu{\delta\to 0}
\frac{1}{\delta}\cdot \,\int\uuu 0^\delta\,
|f(x)+f(\vvv x)\vvv 2A|\, dx=0\tag{i}
\]
\[
\int\uuu 0^\delta\,
|f(x)+f(\vvv x)\vvv 2A|^2\, dx\leq C\cdot \delta
\quad
\text{holds for some constant} \quad C\tag{ii}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
In the same way we can impose this  condition at  every point
$\vvv \pi<x\uuu 0<\pi$. To simplify the subsequent notations
we take $x=0$. 
If  $x=0$ is a Lebesgue point for $f$
and $A$  the  Lebesgue value we have (i).
Hence Lebesgue's Theorem entails  that (i)
holds almost everywhere when 
$x=0$ is replaced by other points $x\uuu 0$.
We leave it to the reader to show
that the second condition also is valid almost everywhere
when $f$ is square integrable.
Next,  expand $f$ in a Fourier series
\[ 
f(x)=\frac{a\uuu 0}{2}+ \sum\, a\uuu k\cdot \cos kx+\sum\, b\uuu k\cdot \sin kx
\]
and with $x=0$ we consider the partial sums
\[ 
s\uuu n(0)= \frac{a\uuu 0}{2}+ a\uuu 1 +\ldots+a\uuu n+
b\uuu 1+\ldots+b\uuu n
\]
The result below is proved 
in Carelan's cited article.


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{5.3 Theorem.}}
\emph{Assume that $f$ has a determined value $A$ at $x=0$.
Then the following hold for every positive integer $k$}
\[
\lim\uuu{n\to\infty}\, 
\frac{1}{n+1}\cdot
\sum\uuu{\nu=0}^{\nu=n}\, |s\uuu\nu\vvv A|^k=0\tag{*}
\]

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Set $A=f(0)$ and $s_n=s_n(0)$. Introduce the function:
\[ 
\phi(x)= f(x)+f(\vvv x)\vvv 2A\implies
\]
\[
s\uuu n\vvv A=
\int\uuu 0^\pi\, \frac{\sin (n+1/2)x}{\sin\, x/2}\cdot \phi(x)\cdot dx\tag{0}
\]
where Dini's kernel was used.
By
trigonometric formulas   (0)
is  expressed by 
three terms for each
$0<\delta<\pi$:
\newpage

\[
\alpha\uuu n=\frac{1}{\pi}\cdot \int\uuu 0^\delta\, 
\sin nx\cdot\cot x/2\cdot
\phi(x)\cdot dx\tag{1}
\]
\[ 
\beta\uuu n= 
\frac{1}{\pi}\cdot\int\uuu \delta ^\pi\, \sin nx\cdot\cot x/2\cdot
\phi(x)\cdot dx\tag{2}
\]
\[
\gamma\uuu n=\frac{1}{\pi}\cdot\int\uuu 0^\pi\, \cos nx\cdot \phi(x)\cdot dx\tag{3}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
By Hlder's inequality it suffices to show Theorem 5.3  if
$k=2p$ is an even integer. Minkowski's inequality gives

\[
\bigl[\,\sum\uuu{\nu=0}^{\nu=n} |s\uuu\nu\vvv A|^{2p}\,\bigr]^{1/2p}\leq
\bigl[\,\sum\uuu{\nu=0}^{\nu=n}|\alpha\uuu \nu|^{2p}\,\bigr]^{1/2p}+
\bigl[\,\sum\uuu{\nu=0}^{\nu=n}|\beta\uuu \nu|^{2p}\,\bigr]^{1/2p}+
\bigl[\,\sum\uuu{\nu=0}^{\nu=n}|\gamma\uuu \nu|^{2p}\,\bigr]^{1/2p}\tag{4}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Denote by $o(\delta)$ small ordo and $O(\delta)$ is big ordo.
When $\delta\to 0$
we shall establish the following:
\[
\bigl[\,\sum\uuu{\nu=0}^{\nu=n}|\alpha\uuu \nu|^{2p}\,\bigr]^{1/2p}=
n^{1+1/2p)}\cdot o(\delta)\tag{i}
\]
\[
\bigl[\,\sum\uuu{\nu=0}^{\nu=n}|\beta\uuu \nu|^{2p}\,\bigr]^{1/2p}\leq K\cdot p\cdot
\delta^{\vvv 1/2p}\tag{ii}
\]
\[
\bigl[\,\sum\uuu{\nu=0}^{\nu=n}|\gamma\uuu \nu|^{2p}\,\bigr]^{1/2p}\leq K
\tag{iii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
In (ii-iii) $K$ is an absolute constant which is independent of
$p,n$ and $\delta$.
Let us first see why (i\vvv iii) give Theorem 5.3.
Write $o(\delta)= \epsilon(\delta)\cdot \delta$
where $\epsilon(\delta)\to 0$.
With these notations (4) gives:
\[
\bigl[\,\sum\uuu{\nu=0}^{\nu=n} |s\uuu\nu\vvv A|^{2p}\,\bigr]^{1/2p}\leq
n^{1+1/2p} \cdot \delta\cdot \epsilon(\delta)
+Kp\cdot \delta^{\vvv 1/2p}+K\tag{5}
\]


\noindent
Next, let  $\rho >0$ and choose $b$ so large that
\[
pKb^{\vvv 1/2p}<\rho/3
\]
Take $\delta=b/n$ and with $n$ large it follows that
$\epsilon(\delta)$ is so small that
\[ 
b\cdot \epsilon(b/n)<\rho/3
\]
Then right hand side in (5) is majorized by
\[
\frac{2\rho}{3}\cdot n^{1/2p}+ K
\]
When $n$ is large we also have
\[
K\leq \frac{\rho}{3}\cdot n^{1/2p}
\]



\noindent 
Hence the left hand side in (*) is majorized by
$\rho\cdot n^{1/2p}$ for all sufficiently large $n$.
Since $\rho>0$ was arbitrary we get Theorem 5.3  when  the power 
is raised by $2p$.


\bigskip

\centerline{\bf{Proof of (i\vvv iii)}}
\bigskip

\noindent
To obtain (i) we use the triangle inequality
which gives the following for every integer $\nu\geq 1$:
\[ 
|a_\nu|\leq \frac{2}{\pi}\cdot \max_{0\leq x\leq\delta} 
|\sin \nu x\cdot\cot x/2|\cdot\int_0^\delta\, |\phi(x)|\, dx
=\nu\cdot o(\delta)
\]
where the small ordo  $\delta$-term comes from the hypothesis expressed by (*)
in the introduction. Hence
the left hand side above  is majorized by
\[
\bigl[\sum_{\nu=1}^{\nu=n}\, \nu^{2p}\,\bigr]^{\frac{1}{2p}}
 \cdot o(\delta)=
n^{1+1/2p}\cdot o(\delta)
\]
which was requested to get  (i).
To prove (iii) we  notice  that
\[
\gamma_0^2+2\cdot \sum _{\nu=1}^\infty
\gamma_\nu^2=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\pi\, |\phi(x)|^2\, dx
\]
Next, we have
\[
\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty \, |\gamma_\nu|^{2p}\leq
\bigl[\, \sum_{\nu=1}^\infty \, |\gamma_\nu|^2\, \bigr ]^{1/2p}\leq K
\]
where $K$
exists since
$\phi$ is square-intergable on $[0,\pi]$ and (iii) follows.
\medskip


\noindent
\emph{Proof of (ii)}.
Here several steps are required.
For each $0<s<\pi$
we define the  function $\phi\uuu s(x)$
by
\[
\phi\uuu s(x)=\phi(x)\quad\colon\quad 0<x<s
\] 
and extend it to an odd function, i.e. $\phi\uuu s(\vvv x)=\vvv \phi\uuu s(x)$
while  $\phi\uuu s(x)=0$ when $|x|>s$.
This odd function has a sine series
\[
\phi\uuu s(x)=\sum\uuu{\nu=1}^\infty
c\uuu\nu(s)\cdot \sin x\tag{A}
\]
Let us also introduce the functions
\[
\rho(s)=\int\uuu 0^s\, |\phi(x)|\cdot dx\quad\text{and}\quad
\Theta (s)=\int\uuu 0^s\, |\phi(x)|^2\cdot dx\tag{B}
\]


\noindent
The crucial step   towards the proof of (ii)
is the following:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Sublemma.}} \emph{One has the inequality}
\[
\sum\uuu{|nu=1}^\infty\, |c\uuu\nu(s)|^{2p}\leq
(\frac{2}{\pi})^{2p\vvv 1}\cdot \Theta(s)\cdot \rho(s)^{2p\vvv 2}
\]


\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
We  employ convolutions and define inductively a sequence
of functions $\{\phi\uuu{n,s}(x)\}$
where
$\phi\uuu{1,s}(x)= \phi\uuu s(x)$ and 
\[ 
\phi\uuu{n+1,s}(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}
\int\uuu {\vvv \pi}^\pi\, 
\phi\uuu{n,s}(y)\phi\uuu s(x+y)\cdot dy
\]
Since convolution yield products of the Fourier coefficients
and $2p$Êis an even integer we  have the
standard formula:
\[
\sum\uuu{\nu=1}^\infty \, c\uuu n(s)^{2p}
=\phi\uuu{2p,s}(0)\tag{1}
\]
Next, using the Cauchy\vvv Schwarz inequality the reader may verify that

\[
|\phi\uuu{2,s}(x)|\leq \frac{2}{\pi}\cdot \Theta(x)
\]
This entails that
\[
\phi\uuu{3,s}(x)\leq
\frac{1}{\pi}
\int\uuu{\vvv \pi}^\pi\,
|\phi\uuu{2,s}(y)|\cdot |\phi\uuu s(x+y)|\cdot dy
\leq 
\frac{2}{\pi^2}\cdot \Theta(s)\cdot 
\int\uuu{\vvv \pi}^\pi\,
|\phi\uuu s(x+y)|\cdot dy=(\frac{2}{\pi})^2\cdot
 \Theta(s)\cdot \rho(s)
\]
Proceeding in this way it follows by an induction that
\[
\phi\uuu{2p,s}(x)\leq (\frac{2}{\pi})^{2p\vvv 1}
 \cdot \Theta(s)\cdot (\rho(s))^{2p\vvv 2}
\]
This holds in particular when $x=0$ and then (1) above gives the sublemma.
\newpage

\noindent
{\emph{Proof continued.}
We have by definition

\[
\beta\uuu\nu=\frac{2}{\pi}\int\uuu{\delta}^\pi\,\sin\,\nu x\cdot
\frac{1}{2}\cot (\frac{x}{2})\cdot \phi(x)\cdot dx
\]
An  integration by parts and the construction of the Fourier coefficients
$\{c\uuu\nu(s)\}$ which applies with $s=\delta$
give:
\[
\beta\uuu\nu=
\vvv \frac{1}{2}
\cdot \,\cot \delta/2\cdot c\uuu\nu(\delta)+
+\frac{1}{4}
\int \uuu\delta^\pi\, 
c\uuu\nu(x)\cdot
\text{cosec}^2 (\frac{x}{2})\cdot dx\tag{C}
\]
Now we  profit upon Minkowski's inequality.
Let $q$ be the conjugate of $2p$, i.e $\frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{2p}=1$
and choose  $\{\xi\uuu\nu\}$ to be the   sequence in $\ell^q$
of unit norm such that
\[
|\sum \xi\uuu\nu\cdot \beta\uuu\nu|=||\beta\uuu\bullet||\uuu{2p}
\]
where the last term is the left hand side in (ii).
At the same time (*) above and the triangle inequality give
\[
||\beta\uuu\bullet||\uuu{2p}\leq 
\vvv \frac{1}{2}
\cdot \,\cot (\delta/2)\cdot \sum\, |c\uuu\nu(\delta)|\cdot |\xi\uuu\nu|+
\frac{1}{4}\int \uuu\delta^\pi\, 
\text{cosec}^2 (\frac{x}{2})\cdot \sum\,|
c\uuu\nu(x)\cdot\xi\uuu\nu|\cdot dx\leq
\]
\[
 \frac{1}{2}
\cdot \,\cot (\delta/2)\cdot ||c\uuu\bullet(\delta)||\uuu{2p}
+\frac{1}{4}\int \uuu\delta^\pi\, 
\text{cosec}^2 (\frac{x}{2})\cdot 
||c\uuu\bullet(x)||\uuu{2p}\cdot dx\tag{D}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
At this stage we apply the sublemma  and the assumption which 
give a constant $K$ such that
\[
\Theta(s)\leq K\quad\text{and}\quad \rho(s)\leq K\cdot s\tag{E}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
The last estimate actually is weaker than the hypothesis
but it will be  sufficient to get the requested
estimate of the $\ell^{2p}$\vvv norm  in (ii). Namely,
the sublemma  gives a constant $K\uuu 1$ such that
\[
||c\uuu\bullet(\delta)||\uuu{2p}\leq K\uuu 1\cdot \delta^{1\vvv 1/p}
\]
At the same time we have a constant
$K\uuu 2$ such that
\[
\cot (\delta/2)\leq \frac{K\uuu 2}{\delta}
\]
The product in the first term from (D) is therefore majorized by
$K\uuu 1K\uuu 2\cdot \delta^{\vvv 1/2p}$ as requested in (ii).
For the second term we use again the sublemma
which first gives
\[
||c\uuu\bullet(x)||\uuu p\leq K\cdot x^{\vvv 1/2p}
\]
At this stage we leave it to the reader to verify that
we get a constant $K$ so that
\[
\int \uuu\delta^\pi\, 
x^{\vvv 1/2p}\cdot 
\text{cosec}^2 (\frac{x}{2})\cdot dx\leq K\cdot \delta^{\vvv 1/2p}
\] 
which finishes the proof of (ii).
\bigskip

\noindent{\bf{The case when
$f$ is continuous.}}
Under the normalisation that
the $L^2$-integral of $f$ is $\leq 1$
the inequalities (ii-iii) hold for an absolute constant $K$.
In (i) we notice that
the construction of
$\phi$ and the definition of $\omega_f$
give the estimates
\[ 
|a_\nu|\leq \nu\cdot \delta\cdot \omega_f(\delta)
\]
With $p=2$ the proof of Theorem 5.3  entails 
that (i)  is majorised by
\[
n^{1+1/2}\cdot \delta\cdot \omega_f(\delta)
\]
This holds for every $0\leq x\leq 2\pi$ and from the previous proof we conclude that
the following hold for each
$n\geq 2$ and every $0<\delta<\pi$:
\[ 
\mathcal D_n(f)\leq\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}}\cdot
[n^{1+1/2}\cdot \delta\cdot \omega_f(\delta)+2K\delta^{-1/2}+K]\tag{i}
\]
With $n\geq 2$ we take $\delta=n^{-1}$ and see that
(i) gives a requested constnt in Theorem 5.1

\centerline{\bf\large{6. The Denjoy conjecture}}

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Introduction.}
Let $\rho$ be a positive integer and 
$f(z)$  is an entire function such that there exists some
$0<\epsilon<1/2 $  and a constant $A_\epsilon$ such that
\[
|f(z)|\leq A_\epsilon\cdot e^{|z|^{\rho+\epsilon}}\tag{0.1}
\]


\noindent
hold for every $z$. Then we say that 
$f$ has integral order $\leq\rho$.
Next, the entire function $f$ has an asymptotic value $a$
if there exists a Jordan curve
$\Gamma$ parametrized
by
$t\mapsto\gamma(t)$ for $t\geq 0$ such that
$|\gamma(t)|\to \infty$ as $t\to+\infty$ and
\[
\lim_{t\to+\infty}\, f(\gamma(t))=a\tag{0.2}
\]


\noindent
In 1920 Denjoy raised the conjecture that
(0.1) implies that the entire function $f$ has at most
$2\rho$ many different asymptotic values. Examples show that
this upper bound is sharp.
The Denjoy conjecture was proved in 1930 by  Ahlfors in [Ahl].
A few years later T. Carleman found an alternative  proof based
upon a certain differential inequality.
Theorem A.3 below 
has  applications beyond the proof of
the Denjoy conjecture
for estimates of
harmonic measures. See [Ga-Marsh].

\bigskip

\centerline{\bf A. The  differential inequality.}
\bigskip


\noindent
Let $\Omega$ be a connected open set in ${\bf{C}}$ whose
intersection $S\uuu x$ between
a  vertical line  $\{\mathfrak{Re}\, z=x\}$
is a bounded set
on the real $y$-line for every $x$.
When $S_x\neq\emptyset $ it is the disjoint union
of open
intervals $\{(a_\nu,b_\nu)\}$ and we set
\[ 
\ell(x)=\max\uuu \nu \,(b_\nu-a_\nu)\tag{*}
\]

\medskip


\noindent
Next, let
$u(x,y)$ be a positive harmonic   function
in $\Omega$ which 
extends to a continuous function on
the closure $\bar\Omega$  with the boundary values identical to zero.
Define the function $\phi$ by:
\[ 
\phi(x)=\int_{S_x}\,u^2(x,y)\cdot dy\tag{1}
\]
The Federer-Stokes theorem gives
the following  formula for the derivatives of $\phi$:
\[ 
\phi'(x)=2\int_{S_x}\,u_x\cdot u(x,y) dy\tag{2}
\]
\[
\phi''(x)=2\int_{S_x}\,u_{xx}\cdot u(x,y) dy+
2\int_{S_x}\,u^2_x\cdot dy\tag{3}
\]


\noindent
Since $\Delta(u)=0$ when $u>0$ we have
\[
2\int_{S_x}\,u_{xx}\cdot u(x,y) dy=-
2\int_{S_x}\,u_{yy}\cdot u(x,y) dy=
2\int u_y^2 dy\tag{4}
\]
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applied in (2) gives
\[
\phi'(x)^2\leq 4\cdot \int_{S_x}\,u^2_x\cdot\int_{S_x} u^2(x,y) dy
=4 \cdot \phi(x)\cdot \int_{S_x}u_x^2dy\tag{5}
\]
Hence (4) and (5) give:
\[ 
\phi''(x)\geq 2\int\uuu{S\uuu x} \,u^2_y(x,y)\cdot dy+\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{\phi'^2(x)}{\phi(x)}\tag{6}
\]
Next, since $u(x,y)=0$ at the end-points of all intervals of $S_x$,
\emph{Wirtinger's 
inequality}
and the definition of $\ell(x)$ give:
\[
\int\uuu{S\uuu x} u^2_y(x,y)\cdot dy\geq \frac{\pi^2}{\ell(x)^2}\cdot\phi(x)\tag{7}
\]


\noindent
Inserting (7) in (6) we have  proved
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf A.1 Proposition} \emph{The $\phi$-function satisfies the differential inequality}
\[
\phi''(x)\geq \frac{2\pi^2}{\ell(x)^2}\cdot\phi(x)+\frac{\phi'^2(x)}{2\phi(x)}
\]


\noindent
\emph{Proof continued.}
The maximum
principle for harmonic functions implies that the $\phi(x)>0$
when $x>0$ and hence there exists
a $\psi$-function where
$\phi(x)= e^{\psi(x)}$. It follows that

\[ 
\phi'=\psi' e^\psi\quad\text{and}\quad\,\phi''=
\psi''e^\psi+\psi'^2e^\psi
\]

\noindent
Now  Proposition A.1 gives
\[
 \psi''+\frac{\psi'^2}{2}\geq \frac{2\pi^2}{\ell(x)^2}\tag{*}
\]
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf {A.2 An integral inequality.}}
From (*) we obtain
\[
\frac{2\pi}{\ell(x)}\leq\sqrt{\psi'(x)^2+2\psi''(x)}\,\leq
\psi'(x)+\frac{\psi''(x)}{\psi'(x)}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Taking the integral we get
\[ 
2\pi\cdot\int_0^x\,\frac{dt}{\ell(t)}\leq \psi(x)+\log\,\psi'(x)+O(1)
\leq \psi(x)+,\psi'(x)+O(1)\tag{**}
\]
where $O(1)$ is a remainder 
term which is bounded  independent of $x$. Taking the integral once more we 
obtain:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf {A.3 Theorem.}}
\emph{The following inequality holds:}


\[
2\pi\cdot\int_0^x\, \frac{x-s}{\ell(s)}\cdot ds\leq
\int_0^x\,\psi(s)\cdot ds+\psi(x)+O(x)
\]
\emph{where the remainder term $O(x)$ is bounded by $Cx$ for 
a fixed constant.}

\bigskip


\centerline {\bf B. Solution to the Denjoy conjecture}
\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf B.1 Theorem.}
\emph{Let $f(z)$ be entire of some integral order
$\rho\geq 1$. Then $f$ has at most $2\rho$ many different asymptotic values.}
\bigskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Suppose $f$ has $n$ different asymptotic values
$a_1,\ldots,a_n$.
To each  $a_\nu$ there exists a Jordan arc $\Gamma_\nu$ as described in the introduction.
Since the $a$-values are different the $n$-tuple of
$\Gamma$-arcs are separated from each other when
$|z|$ is large.
So we can find some $R$ such that
the arcs are disjoint in the exterior disc
$|z|>R$. We may also consider the tail of each arc, i.e. starting from
the last point on $\Gamma_\nu$ which intersects the circle
$|z|=R$. So now we have an $n$-tuple of disjoint Jordan
curves in $|z|\geq R$ where each curve intersects $|z|=R$ at some point $p_\nu$ and after the curves moves to the point at infinity. See figure.
Next, we take one of these curves, say $\Gamma_1$. Let
$D_R^*$ be the exterior disc $|\zeta |>R$.
In the domain
$\Omega={\bf{C}}\setminus \Gamma_1\cup\,D_R^*$ we can choose a single-valued
branch of $\log \zeta$ and with $z=\log\,\zeta $
the image of $\Omega$ is a simply connected domain 
$\Omega^*$
where
$S_x$ for each $x$ has length strictly less than
$2\pi$
The images of the $\Gamma$-curves
separate $\Omega^*$
into $n$ many disjoint connected
domains
denoted by $D_1,\ldots,D_n$ where
each $D_\nu$ is bordered by a pair of images of $\Gamma$-curves
and a portion of the vertical line $x=\log \,R$.

\medskip

\noindent
Let $\zeta=\xi+i\eta$ be the complex coordinate
in $\Omega^*$.
Here we get the analytic function
$F(\zeta)$ where
\[ F(\text{log}(z))= f(z)
\]
We notice that $F$ may have more growth than $f$. Indeed, we get
\[
|F(\xi+i\eta)|\leq \text{exp}\bigl(e^{(\rho+\epsilon)\xi}\bigr)\tag{1}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
With $u=\text{Log}^+\,|F|$ it follows that
\[ 
u(\xi,\eta)\leq e^{(\rho+\epsilon)\xi}\tag{2}
\]


\noindent
Hence the $\phi$-function constructed
during the proof of Theorem A.3  satisfies
\[
\phi(\xi)\leq e^{2(\rho+\epsilon)\xi}
\]
It follows that the $\psi$-function satisfies


\[ 
\psi(\xi)=2\cdot (\rho+\epsilon)\xi+O(1)\tag{3}
\]


\noindent Now we  apply Theorem A.3  in each region $D_\nu$
where we have a function
$\ell_\nu(\xi)$ constructed by (0) in section A. 
This gives the inequality
\[
2\pi\cdot \int_R^\xi\, \frac{\xi-s}{\ell_\nu(s)}\cdot ds\leq
\int_R^\xi\, (\rho+\epsilon)s\cdot ds+(\rho+\epsilon)\xi+O(1)\quad\colon\quad
1\leq \nu\leq n\tag{4}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Next, recall the elementary inequality which asserts that if $a\uuu 1,\ldots,a\uuu n$
is an arbitrary $n$\vvv tuple of positive numbers then
\[
\sum\,a\uuu \nu\cdot \sum\, \frac{1}{a_\nu}\geq n^2
\tag{5}
\]
For each $s$ we apply this to the $n$\vvv tuple
$\{\ell\uuu \nu(s)\}$ where we also have
\[ 
\sum\,\ell\uuu \nu(s)\leq 2\pi
\] 
\noindent
So  a summation in (4) over $1\leq \nu\leq n$ gives
\[
n\cdot  \int_R^\xi\, (\xi-s)\cdot ds\leq
\int_R^\xi\, (\rho+\epsilon)s\cdot ds+(\rho+\epsilon)\xi+O(1)\tag{6}
\]
Another integration gives:
\[ 
n\cdot\frac{\xi^2}{2}\leq (\rho+\epsilon)\cdot \xi^2+O(\xi)\tag{7}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
This inequality can only hold for large $\xi$ if
$n\leq 2(\rho+\epsilon)$ and since  $\epsilon<1/2$ is assumed
it follows that 
$n\leq 2\rho$ which finishes the proof of the Denjoy conjecture.

\noindent
{\bf{Introduction.}}
We expose  Carleman's article
\emph{ber eine nichtlineare Randwertaufgabe bei der Gleichung $\Delta u=0$}
(Mathematisches Zeitschrift vol. 9 (1921). 
Here is the equation to be considered: Let
$\Omega$ be a bounded domain in ${\bf{R}}^3$
with $C^1$-boundary and
${\bf{R}}^+$ the non-negative real line where  $t$ is the coordinate.
Let $F(t,p)$
be a real-valued and continuous function
defined on  ${\bf{R}}^+\times\partial\Omega$.
Assume that 
\[
t\mapsto F(t,p)\tag{0,1}
\]
is strictly increasing  for every fixed $p\in\partial\Omega$
and that $F(0,p)\geq 0$. Moreover,  
\[
\lim_{t\to\infty} F(t,p)=+\infty\tag{0.2}
\] 
holds uniformly with respect to $p$.
For a given point $q_*\in\Omega$ we seek a function $u(x)$
which is harmonic in $\Omega\setminus\{q_*\}$
and at $q_*$ it is locally $\frac{1}{|x-q_*|}$ plus a harmonic function
and on $\partial\Omega$
the  inner normal derivative $\partial u/\partial n$ satisfies the 
equation
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}(p)= F(u(p),p)\quad \colon p\in\partial\Omega\tag{*}
\]

\bigskip

\noindent 
Finally  it is required that $u$
extends to a continuous function on
$\partial\Omega$.
\medskip

\noindent {\bf {0.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{For each $F$ as above the boundary value problem has a unique solution.}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
The strategy in Carleman's proof is to consider
the family of boundary value problems where we for each
$0\leq h\leq 1$ seek $u\uuu h$ to satisfy
\[
\frac{\partial u\uuu h}{\partial n}(p)=(1\vvv h)u\uuu h+ h\cdot  F(u\uuu h(p),p)\quad \colon p\in\partial\Omega\tag{**}
\]
and $u\uuu h$ has the same pole as $u$ above.
Before we start to consider the equations in (**)
we establish some preliminary results about uniqueness in (*).




\bigskip


\centerline {\bf{A.0. Proof of uniqueness.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Let $u_1$ and $u_2$ be  two solutions to the equation (*).
Then   
$u_2-u_1$.
is harmonic in
$\Omega$ and
if $u\uuu 1\neq u\uuu 2$ we may
assume that
the maximum of $u\uuu 2\vvv u\uuu 1$ is $>0$.
The maximum is attained at some $p\uuu *\in\partial\Omega$
and  the strict maximum principle for harmonic functions gives:
\[
u\uuu 2(x)\vvv u\uuu 1(x)<
u\uuu 2(p\uuu *)\vvv u\uuu 1(p\uuu *)\tag{i}
\] 
for all $x\in\Omega$. With $v=u\uuu 2\vvv u\uuu 1$
we have
\[
\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}(p)=F(u_2(p),p)-F(u_1(p),p)
\]
Now (0.1) and (*) entail that
$\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}(p\uuu *)>0$
and since we have taken an inner normal derivative this violates
(i) which proves the uniqueness.


\bigskip



\centerline {\bf{A.1 Montone properties.}}
\bigskip


\noindent
Let $F_1$ and $F_2$ be a pair of  functions which both satisfy
(0.1) and (0.2) and suppose that  
\[ 
F_1(t,p)\leq F_2(t,p)\quad\colon\, (t,p)\in{\bf{R}}^+\times\partial\Omega
\]
If $u_1$, respectively $u_2$ solve (*) for $F_1$ and $F_2$
it follows that
$u_2(q)\leq u_1(q)$ for all $q\in\Omega$.
To see this we set $v=u_2-u_1$ which is harmonic in
$\Omega$.
If $p\in\partial\Omega$ we have
\[
\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}(p)=F_2(u_2(p),p)-F_1(u_1(p),p)\tag{i}
\]
Suppose that the maximum of $v$ is $>0$ and taken at some
$p_*\in\partial\Omega$.
Then
\[
u_2(p_*)>u_1(p_*)\tag{ii}
\]
Next, since $v$ attains the maximum at $p_*$
the inner nortmal derivative
$\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}(p_*)$ must be $\leq 0$
and  (i) gives
\[ 
F_2(u_2(p_*)p_*)>F_2(u_1(p_*),p_*)\geq F_1(u_1(p_*),p_*)\tag{iii}
\]
Now we get a contradiction since
the hypothesis (0.1) implies that
(ii) and (iii) cannot hold at the same time.





\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.2. A bound for the maximum norm.}}
Let $u$ be a solution to (*) and $M_u$ denotes
the maximum norm of its restriction to
$\partial\Omega$. Choose
$p^*\in\partial\Omega$
such that
\[
 u(p^*)=M_u\tag{1}
\]
Let $G$ be the Green's function which has a pole
at $Q_*$ while $G=0$ on $\partial\Omega$. Now
\[
h=u-M_u-G
\] 
is a harmonic function in
$\Omega$.
On the boundary we have $h\leq 0$
and $h(p^*)=0$. So $p^*$ is a maximum point for this harmonic function
in the whole closed domain $\bar\Omega$.
It follows that
\[ 
\frac{\partial h}{\partial n}(p^*)\leq 0\implies
\] 
\[
F(u(p^*),p^*)=\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}(p^*)\leq
\frac{\partial G}{\partial n}(p^*)
\]
Set
\[ 
A^*=\max_{p\in\partial\Omega}\, \frac{\partial G}{\partial n}(p)
\]
Then we have
\[ 
F(M_u,p^*)\leq A^*\tag{*}
\]
Hence the assumption (0.2) for $F$ this gives a robust   estimate for the 
maximum norm $M_u$.
Next, let $m_u$ be the minimum of $u$ on $\partial\Omega$ and
consider the harmonic function
\[
h=u-m_u-G
\]
This time $h\geq 0$ on $\partial\Omega$
and if $u(p_*)=m_u$ we have $h(p_*)=0$
so here $p_*$ is a minimum for $h$.
It follows that
\[ 
\frac{\partial h}{\partial n}(p_*)\geq 0\implies
F(u(p_*),p)=\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}(p_*)\geq 
\frac{\partial G}{\partial n}(p_*)
\]
So with
\[
A_*=\min_{p\in\partial\Omega}\,\, \frac{\partial G}{\partial n}(p)
\]
one has the inequality
\[
F(m_u,p^*)\geq A_*\tag{**}
\]



\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}} Above $0<A_*<A^*$ are  constants which are independent of $F$.
Hence the maximum norms of 
solutions $u=u_F$ are controlled if the $F$-functions stay
in a family where  (0.2) holds  uniformly.


\bigskip



\centerline {\bf{B. Neumann's   linear equation.}}

\medskip


\noindent
Let $f(p)$ and $W(p)$
be a pair of continuous functions on the boundary
$\partial \Omega$ where  $W$ is positive, i.e. $W(p)>0$ for every
boundary point.
The classical Neumann
theorem
asserts  that there exists a unique function $U$ which is harmonic in
$\Omega$, extends to a continuous function on
the closed domain and its inner normal  derivative satisfies:




\[ 
\partial U/\partial n(p)=W(p)\cdot U(p)+f(p)\quad p\in\partial\Omega\tag{1}
\] 
The uniqueness  is a consequence of Green's formula.
For suppose that $U_1$ and $U_2$ are two solutions to (1) and set $v=U_1-U_2$.
Since $v$ is harmonic in $\Omega$ it follows that:
\[ 
\iiint_\Omega\, |\nabla(v)|^2 dxdydz+
\iint_{\partial\Omega}\, v\cdot \partial v/\partial n\cdot dS=0
\]
Here $\partial v/\partial n= W(p)v$ and since $W(p)>0$ holds on $\partial\Omega$
we conclude that
$v$ must be identically zero.
For the unique   solution to (1)  some  estimates hold.
Namely, set 
\[
M_U=\max_p\, U(p)\quad\text{and}\quad
m_U=\min_p\, U(p)
\] 

\medskip

\noindent
Since $U$ is harmonic in $\Omega$ the
the  maximum and the minimum are taken on the boundary.
If $U(p^*)= M_U$ for some $p^*\in\partial \Omega$
we have $\partial U/\partial n(p^*)\leq 0$.
Set

\[
W_*=\min_p \, W(p)
\]
By assumption $W_*>0$
and we get 
\[
M_U\cdot W(p^*)+f(p^*)=\partial U/\partial n(p^*)\leq 0\implies
M_U\leq  \frac{|f|_{\partial\Omega}}{W_*}
\]
where
$|f|_{\partial\Omega}$ is the maximum norm of $f$ on the boundary.
In the same way one verifies that
\[
m_U\geq -\frac{|f|_{\partial\Omega}}{W_*}
\]
Hence  the following inequality holds for the
 the maximum norm  $|U|_{\partial\Omega}$ :
\[
|U|_{\partial\Omega}\leq
\frac{|f|_{\partial\Omega}}{W_*}\tag{*}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{B.1 Estimates for first order derivatives.}}
Let $p\in\partial \Omega$ and denote by $N$
the inner normal at $p$. Since $\partial\Omega$ is of class $C^1$
a sufficiently small line segment from $p$ along
$N$ stays in $\Omega$. So at points $q=p+\ell \cdot N$
we can take the directional derivative of $U$ along $N_p$
This gives  a function

\[
 \ell\mapsto \partial U/\partial N(p+\ell\cdot N)
\]
Since the boundary is $C^1$
these functions are defined on a fixed interval $0\leq\ell\leq \ell^*$ for all $p$.
With these notations there exists a constant $B$ such
that 
\[
\bigl|\partial U/\partial N(p+\ell\cdot N)\bigr|\leq B\cdot 
||\partial U/\partial n||_{\partial\Omega}\quad
\colon\, p\in\partial\Omega\,\, \colon\,\, 0\leq \ell\leq \ell^*\tag{**}
\]


\noindent
where the size of $B$ is controlled by the maximum norm of $f$
on $\partial\Omega$ and the positive constant $W_*$ above.
\bigskip


\centerline {\bf{C. Proof of Theorem 1}} 

\bigskip

\noindent
It suffices to prove
the theorem
when
$F(t,p)$ is an analytic function with respect to $t$.
For if we have  an arbitrary
$F$-function 
satisfying  (0.1) and (0.2), then $F$ can be  uniformly
approximated by a sequence 
$\{F_n\}$ of analytic
functions which again satisfy (0.1-0.2). 
If $\{u_n\}$ are the 
unique solutions  to $\{F_n\}$
the  estimates in (B)  show
that there exists a limit
function $\lim_{n\to\infty}  u_n=u$ where  $u$ solves (*) for the given
$F$-function.
So from  now on we assume that $t\mapsto F(t,p)$ is a real-analytic function on
the positive real axis for each $p\in\partial\Omega$
where local power series converge uniformly with respect to $p$. It
remains to prove
the
existence  of  a solution to the PDE in (*) above Theorem 1.


\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{C.1  The successive solutions $\{u_h\}$.}}
To each real number $0\leq h\leq 1$ we seek a solution $u_h$ where
\[
 \frac{\partial u_h}{\partial n}(p)= h\cdot F(u_h(p),p)+(1-h)\cdot u_h(p)\tag{1}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{C.2  The case $h=0$.}}
The  linear Neumann problem
\[
\frac{\partial u\uuu 0}{\partial n}(p)=u_0(p)
\]
has a unique solution
given by
\[ 
u_0=G+\phi
\]
where $G$ is Green's function with a pole at $Q_*$ and $\phi$ is
the harmonic function in
$\Omega$ satisfying the boundary equation
\[
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}(p)+\frac{\partial G}{\partial n}(p)=\phi(p)\tag{i}
\]
Recall that  $G$ is a super-harmonic function in
$\Omega$
where 
$\frac{\partial G}{\partial n}$  is a continuous and positive function on
$\partial\Omega$. This gives a pair of positive constants
$0< \gamma_*<\gamma^*$ such that
\[
\gamma_*\leq \frac{\partial G}{\partial n}(p)\leq \gamma^*
\quad\colon\quad p\in\partial\Omega\tag{ii}
\] 
Let $\phi$ attain its maximum at some
$p^*\in\partial\Omega$. Then  its inner normal derivative at $p^*$ is 
$\leq 0$. Hence (i-ii) and the maximum principle for harmonic functions
entail that
\[
\max_{p\in\bar\Omega}\, \phi(p)\leq \gamma^*
\]
In a similar fashion one proves that
\[
\min_{p\in\bar\Omega}\, \phi(p)\geq \gamma_*
\]
\bigskip

\noindent{\bf{C.3 Local series expansions.}}
Let $0\leq h_0<1$ and suppose we have found the 
solution $u_{h_0}$ in (1) above. Set $u_0=u_{h_0}$
and
with $h=h_0+\alpha$ for some small $\alpha>0$
we shall find  $u_h$ by a series
\[
u_h= u_0+\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty\, \alpha^\nu\cdot u_\nu\tag{C.3.1}
 \]

 
\noindent
The pole at $q_*$  occurs already in $u_0$ so 
$u_1,u_2,\ldots$ are 
harmonic functions in  $\Omega$. There remains to determine
$\{u_\nu\}$
so that the series (3) converges and
$u_h$ yields  a solution to (1). We will  show that this can
be achieved when $\alpha $ is sufficiently small.
To begin with the results from
¤ B give  positive constants $0<c_1<c_2$
such that
\[
0<c_1\leq u_0(p)\leq c_2\quad\colon p\in\partial\Omega\tag{C.3.2}
\]



\noindent
Next,  the analyticity of $F$ with respect to $t$
enables us to write:
\[
 F(u_h(p),p)=
F(u_0(p)+\sum_{k=1}^\infty\, c_k(p)\cdot \bigl[\sum_{\nu=1}^\infty \alpha^\nu u_\nu(p)
 \bigr ]^k\tag{C.3.3}
 \]


\noindent
where $\{c_k(p)\}$ are continuous functions on
 $\partial\Omega$ which appear in an expansion
 \[ 
 F(u_0(p)+\xi,p)=F(u_0(p),p)+
 \sum_{k=1}^\infty\, c_k(p)\cdot \xi^k\tag{C.3.4}
 \]
 
 
\noindent
Here (C.3.2) and the hypothesis on $F$ give 
a pair of positive constants
 $\rho>0$
and $C$  which are independent of $h$ such that
\[
\max_{p\in\partial\Omega}\, |c_k(p)|\leq
C\cdot \rho^k\quad\colon\quad k=0,1,\ldots\tag{C.3.5}
\]
Moreover, the hypothesis (0.2) from the introduction
gives a positive constant $C_*$ which also is independent of $h$
such that
\[
\min_{p\in\partial\Omega}\, |c_1(p)|\geq C_*\tag{C.3.6}
\]

\noindent
{\bf{D. Inductive solutions.}}
To solve (1) we determine
the harmonic functions
$\{u_\nu\}$  inductively
while $\alpha$-powers are identified.
The linear
$\alpha$-term gives  the equation
\[
\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial n}=F(u_0(p),p)-u_0(p)+
(1-h_0)u_1+h_0\cdot c_1(p)\cdot u_1(p)\tag{D.1}
\]



\noindent
For $u_2$ we find that
\[
\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial n}=\bigl(1-h_0+h_0c_1(p)\bigr) u_2
-u_1+c_1(p)u_1+c_2(p)u_1^2\tag{D.2}
\]



\noindent
In general, for $\nu\geq 3$ one has
\[
\frac{\partial u_\nu}{\partial n}=(1-h_0+h_0\cdot c_1(p))\cdot u_\nu+
R_\nu(u_0,\ldots,u_{\nu-1},p)\tag{D.3}
\] 
where $\{R_\nu\}$ are polynomials in the preeceding $u$-functions
whose coefficients are
determined  via the
$c$-functions above.
Notice that (C.3.2) gives a positive constant $C_*$
which again is independent of $h$ such that
\[ 
\min_{p\in\partial\Omega}1-h_0+h_0\cdot c_1(p)\geq C_*\tag{D.4}
\]
Next, the equations in (D.3) can be expressed as follows:
\[
\frac{\partial u_m}{\partial n}= \bigl(1-h_0+h_0\cdot c_1(p)\bigr)
\cdot u_\nu(p)+
\alpha\cdot \bigl\{\,\sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k(p)\bigl[\sum\, \alpha^\nu u_\nu(p)\bigr ]^k\,\bigr\}_{m-1}\tag{D.5}
\]
where the index $m-1$ indicates that one takes out
the coefficient of $\alpha^{m-1}$
when the double sum inside the bracket is expanded as a series in
$\alpha$.
Now (D.5) and the estimates for the inhomogeneous linear equation in
¤ B give  a constant $C^*$ which is independent of $h$ such that
\[
\max_{p\in\Omega}\,  |u_m(p)|\leq
\alpha\cdot \max_{p\in\Omega}\bigl |
\bigl\{\,\sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k(p)\bigl[\sum\, \alpha^\nu u_\nu(p)\bigr ]^k\,\bigr\}_{m-1}
\,\bigr|\leq
\]
\[
C\cdot\alpha\cdot \sum_{k=1}^\infty \,\rho^k\cdot
\max_{p\in\Omega}
\,\bigl |\,\bigl\{ [\,\sum\, \alpha^\nu u_\nu(p)\bigr ]^k
\,\bigr \} _{m-1}\,\bigr|\tag{D.6}
\]
where the last inequality used (C.3.5).

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{E. Majorant series.}}
Finally,  (D.6 ) and a suitable majorant series give
$\alpha_*>0$ such that the series 
(C.3.1) converges if $\alpha\leq \alpha_*$
and gives a solution $u_h$.
Moreover, $\alpha_*$ can be chosen independently 
of $h_0$ and
from this the reader can conclude that
thr imductive condstructions enable us to attain a solution with
$h=1$ which proves Theorem 0.1.

\centerline {\bf{Elliptic operators and their eigenvalues.}}
\bigskip


\noindent
We expose material  from Carleman's  article 
\emph{ber die asymptotische Verteilung
der Eigenwerthe partieller Differentialgleichungen} [xxx 1938].
As pointed out by Carleman the proof of Theorem xx below
verbatim
to give
similar asymptotic expansions (but with other contants)
for
elliptic operators of even order in any number of space 
variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.
As pointed out in [Carleman] similar    asymptotic formulas 
as in Theorem 0.B.1 hold for elliptic operators of arbitrary  even order
$2m$ where $m$ is a positive integer. Here 
one replaces Newton's fundamental solution 
for ellpitic second order operators with
constant coefficients
in ¤ 1 below by those of 
the canonical construction by Fritz John
which are found in a canonical way for elliptic PDE:s 
with constant coefficients of arbitrary high order.
Here we are content to treat  the case $n=3$ and a second order elliptic operator
expressed  
in
${\bf{R}}^3$ with coordinates $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$:
\[
L=
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\sum_{q=1}^{q=3}\, a_{pq}(x)\cdot \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_p\partial x_q}+
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\, a_p(x)
\frac{\partial }{\partial x_p}+a_0(x)
\]
The $a$-functions are real-valued and
in the double sum one has the symmetry $a_{pq}=a_{qp}$.
Moreover we assume that  the $a$-functions are
defined in a neighborhood of the closure of a bounded
domain
$\Omega$ with a $C^1$-boundary, where $\{a_{pq}\}$ are
of class $C^2$, $\{a_p\}$  of class $C^1$ and $a_0$ is continuous.
The elliptic property of
 $L$ means that
for
every $x\in\Omega$ the eigenvalues of the symmetric
matrix
$A(x)$ with elements $\{a_{pq}(x)\}$
are positive.
Under this condition a  result which goes back to work by 
Neumann and Poincar,
asserts
that there exists a positive constant
$\kappa_0$ such that
if $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$ then
the inhomogeneous equation
\[
L(u)-\kappa^2\cdot u=f\quad\colon f\in L^2(\Omega)
\]
has a unique solution $u$ given by a function in
$\Omega$ which extends to the closure where it is zero on
$\partial\Omega$.
This gives  the 
Green's function
$G(x,y;\kappa)$, which for each 
$\kappa\geq \kappa_0$ is defined outside the diagonal in
$\Omega\times\Omega$ and satisfies
the equation
\[
(L-\kappa^2)(\frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot \int_\Omega\, 
G(x,y;\kappa)\, f(y)\, dy )= -f(x)\quad\colon f\in L^2(\Omega)\tag{i}
\]
This  means  that the bounded linear operator on
$L^2(\Omega$ defined by
\[
f\mapsto 
\frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot \int_\Omega\, 
G(x,y;\kappa)\, f(y)\, dy \quad\colon f\in L^2(\Omega)\tag{ii}
\]
is the  inverse to  the densely defined operator
$L-\kappa^2$ on the 
Hilbert space $L^2(\Omega)$ for each $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$.
Now one
studies
the
Green's functions as $\kappa$ varies.
A crucial inequality    was established by Carleman in  lectures at
Institute Mittag-Leffler during  the winter semester 1935-36
which goes as follows.
Let 
$B(x)=A^{-1}(x)$ be the inverse of the symmetric and positive $A$-matrix
and  $\{b_{pq}(x)\}$ are the elements of $B(x)$.
Set
\[
 \phi(x,\xi)=\sqrt{\sum\sum b_{pq}(x)(\xi_p-x_p)(\xi_q-x_q)}
\]

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{1. Theorem.}}
\emph{For each $x\in \Omega$ there exists a constant
$C(x)$ such that}
\[ 
\bigl |\, G(x,\xi;\kappa_0)- \frac{1}{\phi(x,\xi)\cdot \sqrt{\det A(x)}}\,\bigr|
\leq \frac{C(x)}{|x-\xi|^{\frac{1}{4}}}
\quad\colon \xi\in \Omega
\]


\noindent
Notice that we have not  assumed that $L$ is symmetric. So in general
$G(x,y;\kappa)\neq G(y,x;\kappa)$ can hold.
Using this result
Carleman proved the following asymptotic formula for
the eigenvalues of $L$ which in the non-symmetric case may be complex.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2. Theorem.}}
\emph{Let $\{\rho_n\}$ be the absolute values of the eigenvalues of $L$ arranged in a non-decreasing order. Then}
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\, \frac{\rho_n}{n^{\frac{2}{3}}}
=\frac{1}{6\pi^2}\cdot \int_\Omega\, 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\det A(x)}}\, dx\tag{*}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
The formula above is due to Courant and Weyl  when
$P$ is symmetric and extended to
non-symmetric operators in the cited article above
based upon
Carleman 's lectures at Institute Mittag-Leffler in  1935.
The proof of Theorem 1 relies upon the
construction
of fundamental  solutions which is given in ¤ 1 below.
After this  has been achieved,
the asymptotic formula (*)  in Theorem 2 is derived
via  Tauberian theorems for Dirichlet
series which  goes as follows:
Let $\{a_\nu\}$ and  $\lambda_\nu\}$ be two sequences
of positive numbers where
$\lambda_\nu\to +\infty$ and  the series
\[ 
f(x)= \sum_{\nu=1}^\infty\, \frac{a_\nu}{\lambda_\nu+x}
\]
converges when $x>x_*$ for some positive number $x_*$.
Next, for every $x>0$ we
define the function
\[
\mathcal A(x)= \sum_{\{\lambda_\nu<x\}}\, a_\nu
\]
In other words, with $x>0$ we find the largest integer $\nu(x)$
such that $\lambda-{\nu(x)}<x$ and
then $\mathcal A(x)$ is the sum over the $a$-numbers up to
this index. With these notations the following implication holds
for every pair 
$A>0 $ andÊ$0<\alpha<1$


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{3.  Theorem.}}
\emph{Suppose there exists a constant $A>0$ and some
$0<\alpha<1$ such that}
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty}\,
x^\alpha\cdot f(x)=A\implies
\lim_{x\to\infty}\, \mathcal A(x)=
\frac{A}{\pi}\cdot \frac{\sin\, \pi\alpha}{1-\alpha}\cdot x^{1-\alpha}
\]

\medskip












\centerline {\bf{0 Preliminary constructions.}}
\medskip


\noindent
We are given an ellipitic operator $L$
as above
and assume that the coefficients are defined in
the whole space
${\bf{R}}^3$.
To ensure convergence of volume integrals  taken over
the whole of ${\bf{R}}^3$
we add the conditions that
\[ 
\lim_{|x|\to \infty}\ a_{pp}(x)= 1\quad\colon\quad 1\leq p\leq 3
\]
while  $\{a_{pq}\}$ for $p\neq q$ and 
$a_1,a_2,a_3,b$ tend to zero as $|x|\to +\infty$.
This  means that $P$ approaches the Laplace operator when
$|x|$ is large.
Let us 
recall the  notion of a fundamental solution 
which prior to the general notion of distributions
introduced by L. Schwartz, 
was referred to as a 
\emph{Grundlsung}.
First,
the regularity  of the
coefficients of a PDE-operator $P$ 
enable us to construct 
the adjoint
operator:
\[ 
P^*(x,\partial _x)=P-2\cdot \bigl(
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\, \bigl(\sum_{q=1}^{q=3}\, 
\frac{\partial a_{pq}}{\partial x_q}\bigr)\cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial x\uuu p}
-\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\, \frac{\partial a_p}{\partial x_p}
+2\cdot \sum\sum\, \frac{\partial^2 a_{pq}}{\partial x_p\partial x_q}
\]
Partial integration gives  the equation  below for every pair of
$C^2$-functions $\phi,\psi $ in ${\bf{R}}^3$ with compact support:
\[
\int\, P(\phi)\cdot \psi\, dx=
\int\, \phi\cdot P^*(\psi)\, dx
\] 
where
the volume integrals are taken over
${\bf{R}}^3$.
A locally integrable function $\Phi(x)$ in ${\bf{R}}^3$
is  a fundamental solution to $P(x,\partial _x)$
if
\[
\psi(0)=\int\, \Phi\cdot P^*(\psi)\, dx
\] 
hold for every $C^2$-function  $\psi$ with compact support.
Next, to each 
positive number
$\kappa$ we  get  the PDE-operator $P-\kappa^2$ and a
function $\Phi(x;\kappa)$ is a fundamental solution to $P-\kappa^2$
if
\[
\psi(0)=\int\, \Phi(x:\kappa)\cdot (P^*-\kappa^2)(\psi(x))\, dx\tag{1}
\] 
hold for compactly supported $C^2$-functions $\psi$.
Above $\kappa$ appears as an index of $\Phi$, i.e. for each fixed
$\kappa$ we have the locally integrable function
$x\mapsto \Phi(x:\kappa)$.
Next, the  origin can  replaced by a variable point $\xi$ in
${\bf{R}}^3$ and then one seeks
a function
$\Phi^*(x,\xi;\kappa)$ with the property that
\[
\psi(\xi)=\int\, \Phi(x,\xi:\kappa)\cdot (P^*-\kappa^2)(\psi(x))\, dx\tag{*}
\] 
hold for all  $\xi\in{\bf{R}}^3$
and every $C^2$-function $\psi$ with compact support.
Keeping $\kappa$ fixed this means that  
$\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ is a function of six variables  defined in 
${\bf{R}}^3\times {\bf{R}}^3$.
Fundamental solutions are in general not unique. However, when
$P$ is an elliptic operator as above
we shall
give an explicit construction of
fundamental solutions
$\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ for all sufficiently large $\kappa$ in ¤ 1.


\bigskip


\centerline {\bf{1. The construction of $\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$.}}
\medskip


\medskip

\noindent
\emph{1.1 The case when $P$ has constant coefficients.}
Here the   fundamental solution is given by a 
formula  which goes back to Newton's work
in his classic text-books from 1666.
We have the
positive  and symmetric $3\times 3$-matrix
$A= \{a_{pq}\}$. Let
$\{b_{pq}\}$ be the elements of the inverse matrix and recall 
that they are found via Cramr's rule:
\[ 
b_{pq}= \frac{A_{pq}}{\Delta}
\]
where $\Delta=\det(A)$ and $\{A_{pq}\}$  are the cofactor
minors of the $A$-matrix. Put
\[
\alpha=\sqrt{\kappa^2+\frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq} a_pa_q
-b}
\]
where $\kappa$ is chosen so large that
the term under the square-root is $>0$.
Next, define the quadratic form
 \[ 
 B(x)= \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq} a_px_q
\]

\noindent
With these notations Newton's fundamental solution taken
at $x=0$ becomes
\[
H(x;\kappa)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Delta\cdot B(x)}}
\cdot e^{-\alpha \sqrt{B(x)}-
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p,q}b_{pq} a_p\cdot x_q}\tag{*} 
\]


\medskip




\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}} Verify by Stokes  formula
that $H(x;\kappa)$ indeed yields  a fundamental solution
to the PDE-operator $P(\partial_x)-\kappa^2$.



\bigskip



\centerline{\emph{1.2 The case with variable coefficients.}}
\medskip


\noindent
Choose $\kappa_0>0$ such that
\[
\kappa_0^2+\frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq}(\xi) a_p(\xi)a_q(\xi)
-b(\xi)>0\quad\text{hold for all}\quad  \xi\in{\bf{R}}^3
\] 
and for every $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$ we set
\[
\alpha_\kappa(\xi)=
\sqrt{\kappa^2+\frac{1}{2}\, \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq}(\xi) a_p(\xi)a_q(\xi)
-b(\xi)}\tag{i}
\]
Following Newton's construction for the case of constant
coefficients we put:
\[
H(x,\xi;\kappa)=
 \frac{\sqrt{\Delta(\xi)}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{
\sqrt{ \sum_{p,q}\, b_{pq}(\xi)\cdot x_px_q}}
\cdot e^{-\alpha_\kappa(\xi) \sqrt{B(x)}-
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p,q}b_{pq}(\xi) a_p(\xi)\cdot x_q} \tag{ii}
\]





\noindent
When $\xi$ is kept fixed this  function of
$x$ is real analytic  outside the origin and the
singularity at $x=0$
is of Newton's type. In particular
$x\to H(x,\xi;\kappa)$ is locally integrable
as a function of $x$ in a neighborhood of the origin.
Next, for every fixed $\xi$ we consider the  differential operator in the
$x$-space:
\[ 
L_*(x,\partial_x,\xi;\kappa)=
\]
\[\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\sum_{q=1}^{q=3}\, (a\uuu{pq}(x)-
(a\uuu{pq}(\xi))\cdot 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_p\partial x_q}+
\sum_{p=1}^{p=3}\,
(a_p(x)-a_p(\xi))\frac{\partial}{\partial x_p}+ (b(x)-b(\xi))
\]

\medskip

\noindent
For each fixed $\xi$ 
there exists the function
$x\mapsto H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)$
and we  apply the $L_*$-operator on  this $x$-dependent function and put:
\[ 
F(x,\xi;\kappa)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot L_*(x,\partial_x,\xi;\kappa)(H(x-\xi,\xi,\kappa) \tag{iii}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.3 Two  estimates.}}
The hypothesis that $\{a_{pq}(x)\}$ are of class $C^2$ and$\{a_p(x)\}$ of class $C^1$, together with
the limit conditions (*) in ¤ XX   give the existence of positive constants
$C,C_1$ and $k$ such that the following hold when $\kappa\geq\kappa_0$:
\[
|H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)|\leq C\cdot \frac{e^{-k\kappa|x-\xi|}}{|x-\xi|}
\tag{1.3.1}
\]
\[
[F(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq C_1\cdot 
\frac{e^{-k\kappa|x-\xi|^2}}{|x-\xi|^2}
\tag{1.3.2}
\]


\noindent
The verification is left as an exercise.



\bigskip





\noindent
{\bf{1.4 An integral equation.}}
We  seek
$\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ which solves the equation:
\[ 
\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)= \iiint\, F(x,y;\kappa)\cdot \Phi(y,\xi;\kappa)\,dy+F(x,\xi;\kappa)\tag{1}
\]
where the integral is taken over ${\bf{R}}^3$.
To solve (1)
we construct the Neumann series of $F$.
Thus, starting with $F^{(1)}=F$ we set
\[
F^{(k)}(x,\xi;\kappa)=\int_{{\bf{R}}^3}\, F(x,y;\kappa)\cdot
F^{(k-1)}(y,\xi;\kappa)\, dy\quad\colon\quad k\geq 2\tag{1.4.1}
\]
Then (1.3.2 ) gives  the inequality
\[
|F^{(2)}(x,\xi;\kappa)|
\leq C_1^2\iiint
\frac{e^{-k\kappa|\xi-y|^2}}{|x-y|^2\cdot |\xi-y|^2}\cdot dy\tag{i}
\]


\noindent
To estimate (i) we first notice that the triple integral after
the substitution $y-\xi\to u$
becomes
\[
C_1^2\iiint
\frac{e^{-k\kappa|u|^2}}{|x-u-\xi|^2\cdot |u|^2}\cdot du\tag{ii}
\]


\noindent
In  (ii)  the volume integral is integrated in polar
coordinates
and becomes
\[
C_1^2\cdot \int_0^\infty\int_{S^2}\, 
\frac{e^{-k\kappa r^2}}{|x-r\cdot w-\xi|^2}\cdot dwdr\tag{iii}
\]
where $S^2$ is the unit sphere and $dw$ the area measure on
$S^2$ and we see that (iii) becomes
\[
2\pi C_1^2\cdot
\int_0^\infty\int_0^\pi\, 
\frac{e^{-k\kappa r^2}}{(x-\xi)^2+r^2-
2r\cdot |x-\xi|\cdot \sin\theta}\cdot d\theta dr=
\]
\[
\frac{2\pi C_1^2}{|x-\xi|}\cdot\int_0^\infty\, e^{-k\kappa |x-\xi|t}\cdot
\log\, |\frac{1+t}{1-t}|\cdot \frac{dt}{t}\tag{iv}
\]
where the last equality follows by a straightforward computation.

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{1.5 Exercise.}}
Show that (iv) gives the estimate
\[
|F^{(2)}(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq \frac{2\pi C_1^2\cdot C_1^*}{\kappa\cdot |x-\xi|^2}
\]
where $C_1^*$ is a fixed positive constant
which is independent of $x$ and $\xi$ and 
show by an induction over $n$
that one has:
\[
|F^{(n)}(x,\xi;\kappa)|\leq\frac{C_1}{|x-\xi|^2}\cdot 
\bigl[\frac{2\pi C_1^2\cdot C_1^*}{\kappa}\bigr]^{n-1}
\quad\text{hold for every}\quad  n\geq 2\tag{*}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.6 Conclusion.}}
With $\kappa$ so large that
$2\pi C_1^2\cdot C_1^*<\kappa$
it follows form (*) that
the series
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty F^{(n)}(x,\xi;\kappa)
\]
converges when $x\neq\xi$ and
this Neumann series
gives the requested solution $\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$.
Moreover, $\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ satisfies a similar estimate as in (1.3.2) above
with another  constant than $C_2$ instead of $C_1$.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{1.7 Exercise.}}
Above we  have found 
$\Phi$ which satisfies the integral equation in ¤ 1.4
Use  Green's formula to show
that 
$\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)$ gives  a fundamental solution
of $P(x,\partial_x)-\kappa^2$ with a pole at $\xi$.

\medskip


\noindent{\bf {1.8 Some final estimates.}}
The  constructions above show that
the  functions
\[
x\mapsto \Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)\quad\text{and}\quad 
x\mapsto H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)
\]


\noindent
have the same  singularities at $x=\xi$.
Consider the difference
\[
\Psi(x,\xi;\kappa)=\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)-
H(x-\xi,\xi;\kappa)\tag{1.8.1}
\]
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{1.8.2 Exercise.}}
Use the previous constructions to show
that for every $0<\gamma\leq 2$
there is a constant $C_\gamma$
such that
\[
\bigl |\Psi(x,\xi;\kappa)\,\bigr|\leq \frac{C_\gamma}{(\kappa|x-\xi|)^{\gamma}}
\]
hold for every pair $(x,\xi)$ and every $\kappa\geq \kappa_0$.
Together with  (1.3.1)  this gives
an estimate for the fundamental solution $\Phi$.




\bigskip

\centerline {\bf{2. Green's functions.}}
\bigskip


\noindent
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain in
${\bf{R}}^3$.
A Green's function $G(x,y;\kappa)$ attached to this domain
and the PDE-operator $P(x,\partial_x;\kappa)$
is a function which for fixed $\kappa$ is a function in 
$\Omega\times\Omega$
with the following properties:
\[ 
G(x,y;\kappa)=0\quad\text{when}\quad x\in\partial \Omega\quad \text{and}\quad
y\in\Omega\tag{*}
\]
\[
\psi(y)=\int_\Omega\, (P^*(x,\partial_x)-\kappa^2)
(\psi(x))\cdot G(x,y;\kappa)\, dx\quad\colon\quad y\in\Omega\tag{**}
\]


\noindent
hold for all $C^2$-functions $\psi$ with compact support in
$\Omega$.
To find $G$ we 
solve  Dirchlet problems.
With
$\xi\in\Omega$ kept fixed one has the continuous function on
$\partial\Omega$:
\[ 
x\mapsto \Phi^*(x,\xi;\kappa)
\]



\noindent
Solving Dirchlet's problem gives  a unique $C^2$-function
$w(x)$ which satisfies:
\[ 
P(x,\partial_x)(w)+\kappa^2\cdot w=0 \quad\text{holds  in}\quad \Omega
\quad\text{and}\quad w(x)= \Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)\quad\colon x\in\partial\Omega=0
\]

\medskip

\noindent
From the above it is clear that
this gives the requested $G$-function, i.e. one has:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.1 Proposition.}} \emph{The 
the function }
\[ 
G(x,\xi;\kappa)=
\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa)-w(x)
\quad \text{satisfies}\quad (*-**)
\]


 
\noindent
Using the estimates for the $\phi$-function from ¤ 1
we get
estimates for the $G$-function above.
Start with  a sufficiently large
$\kappa_0$ so  that 
$\Phi^*(x,\xi;\kappa_0)$ is a positive function of
$(x,\xi)$. Then the following hold:
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{2.2 Theorem.}}
\emph{One has}
\[ 
G(x,\xi;\kappa_0)=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Delta(x)}\cdot\sqrt{\Phi(x,\xi;\kappa_0)}}
+R(x,\xi)
\]

\noindent
\emph{where the remainder function satisfies the following for all pairs
$(x,\xi)$ in $\Omega$:}
\[ 
|R(x,\xi)|\leq C\cdot |x-\xi|^{-\frac{1}{4}}
\]


\noindent
\emph{and the   constant $C$ only  depends on the  domain 
$\Omega$ and
the PDE-operator $P$.}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
Above the negative power  of 
$|x-\xi|$ is  a fourth-root which means that  the remainder term $R$ 
is more regular  compared
to the first term which behaves like $|x-\xi|^{-1}$ on the diagonal $x=\xi$.

\centerline {\bf{2.4 The integral operator
$\mathcal J$}}. 
\medskip


\noindent
With $\kappa_0$ chosen as above
we
consider the integral operator
which sends a function
$u$ in $\Omega$ to 
\[
\mathcal J_u(x)=\int_\Omega\, G(x,\xi;\kappa_0)\cdot u(\xi)\, d\xi
\]


\noindent
The construction of the Green's function gives:
\[
(P-\kappa_0^2)(\mathcal J_u)(x)=u(x)\quad\colon\quad x\in\Omega\tag{2.4.1}
\] 
In other words, if $E$ denotes the identity we have
the operator equality

\[
P(x,\partial_x)\circ \mathcal J_u=\kappa_0^2\cdot  \mathcal J+E\tag{2.4.2}
\]



\noindent
Consider pairs $(u,\gamma)$ such that 
\[
u(x)+ \gamma\cdot \mathcal J_u(x)=0\quad\colon\quad x\in\Omega\tag{2.4.3}
\] 
The vanishing from (*) for the $G$-function 
implies that $J_u(x)=0$ on $\partial\Omega$. Hence  every
$u$-function which satisfies
in (2.4.3) for some  constant $\gamma$
vanishes   on $\partial\Omega$.
Next, apply $P$ to (2.4.3) and then
the operator formula (2.4.2) gives

\[
0=P(u)+\gamma \kappa_0^2\cdot \mathcal J_u+\gamma\cdot u\implies
P(u)+(\gamma-\kappa_0^2)u=0
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\emph{2.4.4 Conclusion.}}
Hence the boundary value problem (*) from 0.B
is equivalent to find eigenfunctions of 
$\mathcal J$ via (2.4.3) above.

\medskip

\noindent
\centerline {\bf{3. Almost reality of eigenvalues.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Consider the set of eigenvalues $\lambda$ to (*) in (0.B).
Then we have:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{3.1 Proposition.}}
\emph{There exist positive constants $C_*$ and $c_*$ such that
every eigenvalue  $\lambda$ to  (*) in (0.B) satisfies}

\[
|\mathfrak{Im}\,\lambda|^2\leq C_*(\mathfrak{Re}\,\lambda)+c_*)
\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Let $u$ be an eigenfunction where
$P(u)+\lambda\cdot u=0$.
Stokes theorem and the vanishing of $u|\partial\Omega$
give:
\[
0=\int_\Omega\, \bar u\cdot (P+\lambda)(u)\,dx
=-\int_\Omega \, \sum_{p,q}\, a_{pq}(x)\cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}
\frac {\partial \bar u}{\partial x_q}\, dx+
\int_\Omega\, \bar u\cdot( \sum \, a_p(x)
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}\,)\, dx+
\] 
\[
\int_\Omega\, |u(x)|^2\cdot b(x)\, dx+
\lambda\cdot \int\, |u(x)|^2\, dx
\]
\medskip


\noindent
Write $\lambda=\xi+i\eta$.
Separating real and imaginary parts we find the two equations:
\[
\xi\int\, |u|^2\, dx=
\int\, \sum_{p,q} a_{p,q}(x)\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}\cdot 
\frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial x_q}\, dx+
\int\, \bigl(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \sum\, \frac{\partial a_p}{\partial x_p}- b\,\bigr )
\cdot |u|^2\, dx\tag{i}
\]
\[
\eta\int\, |u|^2\, dx=\frac{1}{2i}\int \sum\, a_p\bigl(
u\frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial x_p}-
\bar u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}\,\bigl )\, dx\tag{ii}
\]


\noindent
Set
\[ A= \int\, |u|^2\,dx\quad\colon\quad
B= \int\, |\nabla(u)|^2\,dx
\]
Since $P$ is elliptic there exists a positive constant $k$ such that
\[
\sum_{p,q} a_{p,q}(x)\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_p}>
k\cdot |\nabla(u)|^2
\]
From this we see that (i-ii) gives positive constants $c_1,c_2,c_3$ such that
\[
A\xi>c_1B-c_2B\quad\colon\quad A|\eta|<c_3\cdot \sqrt{AB}\tag{iii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Here (iii) implies that $\xi>-c_2$ and the reader can also confirm that
\[ 
B<\frac{A}{c-1}(\xi+c-2)\quad\colon\quad
A|\eta|< A\cdot c_2\cdot \sqrt{\frac{\xi+c_2}{c_1}}\quad\colon\quad
|\eta|< c_3\cdot \sqrt{\frac{\xi+c_2}{c_1}}\tag{iv}
\]


\noindent Finally it is obvious that (iv) above gives the requested
inequality in Proposition 3.1.

\bigskip

\centerline{\bf{4. The asymptotic  formula.}}
\bigskip


\noindent
Using the results above
where we have found  a good control of the integral operator
$\mathcal J$ and the identification of eigenvalues to $\mathcal j$ and those from (*) in (0.B), one can proceed and apply Tauberian theorems to derive
the asymptotic formula  in Theorem 1 using 
similar methods as described in ¤ XX where we treated
the Laplace operator. 
For details the reader may consult [Carleman:p age xx-xx].

\centerline {\bf{Unbounded operators and quantum mechanics.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Two years after Carleman's cited monograph published 1923,
the mathematical community  was  confronted with new problems
via the new-born quantum mechanics. Some examples are exposed
in ¤ 0.3 under the heading
\emph{Schrdinger equations}. But let us begin
with a question which was raised
in a joint article by Born, Heisenberg and Jordan
[Zeitschrift der Physik vol 24. 1925]:

\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Determine     pairs of linear operators $P$ and $Q$
on the Hilbert space $L^2({\bf{R}})$
of complex-valued and square integrable functions satisfying
the equation}
\[
PQ-QP=\frac{h}{2\pi i}\cdot E\tag{*}
\] 
\emph{where $h$ is a positive constant and $E$ the identity operator.}
\medskip

\noindent
In 
1926 Schrdinger
proposed a solution to (*) using the unbounded operators
\[ 
P(f)= \frac{h}{2\pi i}\cdot \frac{df}{dq}
\quad\colon 
Q(f)= q\cdot f(q)
\] 
where $q$ is the coordinate on the real line.
Here $P$ and $Q$ are densely defined
on
test-functions and (*) follows from derivation rules.
A notable point is that $P$ and $Q$
are symmetric
on the subspace of test-functions in the 
complex Hilbert space $L^2({\bf{R}})$, i.e. one verifies
easily that
\[
\int \, P(f)\cdot \bar g\, dq=
\int \, f\cdot \overline{P(g)}\, dq\quad\colon f,g\in C_0^\infty({\bf{R}})
\]
and similarly for $Q$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Weyl's unitary operators.}}
In an article [Zeitschrift fr physik: Vol. 46 1928]
the search of solutions  to (*) was
reformulated by Weyl into a problem about
unitary operators. Let us first describe this for 
Schrdinger's solution.
If  $\beta$ is a complex number
we get the unitary operator defined on $L^2({\bf{R}})$ by:
\[
V(\beta)(f)(q)= e^{\frac{2\pi i}{h}\cdot \beta q}\cdot f(q)\tag{i}
\]
Then 
\[ 
V(\beta_1+\beta_2)= V(\beta_1)V(\beta_2)
\]
and we also notice that
\[
\lim_{\beta\to 0}\frac{V(\beta)(f)-f)}{\beta}=\frac{2\pi i}{h}\cdot  Q(f)
\] 
For the $P$-operator   the inverse Fourier
transform gives
\[
P(f)(q)=\frac{h}{2\pi i}\cdot \frac{1}{2\pi}\int e^{iq\xi}\cdot (i\xi)\widehat{f}(\xi)\, d\xi
\]
Plancherel's formula yields
unitary operators
for real numbers $\alpha$ defined on test-functions $f$ by
\[
U(\alpha)(f) =e^{\frac{2\pi i}{h}\alpha P}(f)= 
E+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\, 
\frac{1}{n \, !}\cdot (\frac{2\pi i}{h})^n\cdot \alpha^n\cdot P^n(f)
\]
It means that on the $\xi$-line the corresponding unitary
operator $\widehat{U}(\alpha)$ is multiplication with
$e^{i\alpha\xi}$ and hence
\[ 
U(\alpha)(f)(q)=f(q+\alpha)\tag{ii}
\]
It is clear that (i-ii) give
\[
U(\alpha)V(\beta)=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{h} \cdot \alpha\beta}\cdot 
V(\beta)U(\alpha)\tag{**}
\]

\noindent
One is therefore led to determine pairs
of unitary groups  $\{U(\alpha)\}$ and $\{V(\beta)\}$
for which (**) hold. It turns out that Schrdinger's solution 
is unique up to unitary equivalence under the assumption that
one has an irreducible situation.
More precisely one has:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}} \emph{Let
$\{U_*(\alpha)\}$ and $\{V_*(\beta)\}$ be a pair of unitary groups
which satisfies (**). Suppose  in addition that
the sole non-zero closed subspace of  $L^2({\bf{R}})$
which is invariant under all $U_*$- and $V_*$-operators
is
 $L^2({\bf{R}})$. Then there exists a unitary operator
 $S$ on $L^2({\bf{R}})$ such that}
 \[ 
 U_*(\alpha)= SU(\alpha)S^*
 \quad\colon  V_*(\beta)= SV(\beta)S^*
\]
\emph{where the pair 
 $\{U(\alpha)\},\{V(\beta)\}$ is Schrdinger's solution.}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}} This theorem  was proved by J. von Neumann
in the article \emph{Die eindutigkeit der Schrdingerschen Operatoren}
[xxx: 1934].
Actually von Neumann went further and
proved a general result for pairs of unitary groups
which need not be
irreducible.  In this  case
decompositions  into  
invariant and irreducible
subspaces of $L^2({\bf{R}})$ appear. More generally one
can  consider $n$-tuples of pairs satisfying (*)
for $n\geq 2$ where the equations are related  to those
in the $n$-dimensional Weyl algebra of differential operatos with
polynomial coefficients which
leads to the theory about von Neumann algebras. 
For this  we refer to
articles by von Neumann
which illustrate
the importance of
studying unbounded self-adjoint operators.

\centerline {\bf{Poincar's Ergodic Hypothesis}}

\bigskip

\noindent
A problem 
which played a crucial role while the
theory about
unbounded linear operators was developed
stems from the
lecture
\emph{L'avnir des Mathematiques} held at the congress in Rome 1908
by Poincar. He  put forward  that non-linear systems of differential equations
can be expressed by an infinite system of
equations with constant coefficients.
Consider the case where
$n\geq 2$ and $A_1(x),\ldots,A_n(x)$
are polynomials in $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ and 
the non-linear system
\[
\frac{dx_\nu}{dt}= A_\nu(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\tag{1}
\]
where
$t$ is a time variabe.
Taking   monomials in the $x$-variabes give
further equations. For example
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(x_\nu\cdot x_j)= A_\nu(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\cdot x_j+
A_j(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\cdot x_\nu
\]
In this way  (1) can be expressed via a system of
linear equations with constant coefficients in several ways.
Following Poincar  we take a positive function
$\mu(x)$ in ${\bf{R}}^n$ satisfying a growth condition
\[
\mu(x)\leq e^{\alpha\cdot |x|^2}
\]
for some $0<\alpha<1$ where $|x|^2= x_1^2+\ldots+x_n^2$.
The polynomial ring
${\bf{C}}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
has a basis formed by polynomials $\{P_\nu(x)\}$ such that
the integrals
\[ 
\int_{{\bf{R}}^n}\,
P_\nu(x)\cdot P_k(x)\cdot e^{-2|x|^2}\cdot \mu(x)\, dx=\delta(\nu,k)
\] 
where the right hand side is Kronecker's delta-function.
With $\phi_\nu(x)= P_\nu(x)\cdot e^{-|x|^2}$
the $\phi$-functions satisfy an infinite system
\[
\frac{d\phi _\nu}{dt}=\sum\, c_{\nu,j}\cdot \phi_j\tag{2}
\]
where $\{c_{\nu j}\}$ 
are constants and
for each fixed
$\nu$  one has $c_{\nu j}\neq 0$  for finitely many $j$.
A  case of special interest occurs when
solutions to (1)
stay in a compact hypersurface
$S$ in
${\bf{R}}^n$. 
Picard's uniqueness theorem for ODE-equations give
transformations $\{T_t\}$ from $S$ onto itself
where a point $p\in S$ is mapped  to $T_t(P)$, determined by
the values at time $t$ taken by a solution to (1) with initial condition
$x(0)=p$.
Suppose in addition that there
exists a  positive measure $\mu$ on $S$
which is invariant  for
the $T$-operators.
In most applications $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to
the surface measure $d\sigma$ on $S$
and by a suitable change of variables one can
rewrite the original system (1) so that
$d\sigma$ is $T$-invariant. When these conditions hold
we consider a pair $U,V$ of complex-valued
$C^1$-functions on $S$. The invariance entails that
\[
t\mapsto \int_S\, U(T_t(p))\cdot \overline{V(T_t(p))}\, d\sigma(p)
\]
is a constant function of $t$.
Taking the  derivative  at $t=0$
we get
\[
\int_S\, \sum_{j=1}^{\j=n}\,
A_j(p)\cdot \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_j}(p)\cdot 
\overline{Vp)}\, d\sigma(p)+
\int_S\, U(p)\cdot \sum_{j=1}^{\j=n}\,
A_j(p)\cdot\overline{ \frac{\partial V}{\partial x_j}}(p)\, d\sigma(p)\tag{i}
\]
Define the operator
$\Omega$ on the vector space $C^1(S)$ by
\[ 
\Omega(U)(p) =i\cdot \sum_{j=1}^{\j=n}\,
A_j(p)\cdot \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_j}(p)
\]
Then (i) entails that
\[
\langle\Omega(U),V\rangle=
\int_S\,\Omega(U)\cdot \overline{V}\, d\sigma=
\langle U, \Omega(V)\rangle\tag{ii}
\]
Hence  $\Omega$ is a densely defined
and Hermitian operator on the Hilbert space
$L^2(S)$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}} The first "serious attempt" to apply
Poincar's  device in a general set-up 
was done by Fredholm 
in a Comptes Rendus Note from August 1920. He 
pointed out new
obstacles compared to previous  studies of integral equations,
caused by the "inevetible unboundedness"
of Poincar's associated
linear systems.
Fredholm's article   was a  major inspiration when
Carleman  developed the  theory in
[1923].
Concerning  the specific case above where
the invariant surface measure
$\sigma$ exists, the theory
about 
unbounded densely defined Hermitian operators
were later used to confirm Poincar's Ergodic Hypothesis.
We shall not enter a detailed discussion about this but
mention that
the  first rigorous proof was given  by Carleman in
lectures at Mittag-Leffler Institute in 1931.
See the   article 
\emph{Application de la thorie des l'quations intgrales linaires
aux systmes d'quations differntielles non-linaires}
[Acta Math.1932]
for an account. To this one should add that
Birkhoff 
soon after Carelan's lectures in the spring 1931,
established deeper results which lead to almost everywhere
properties in the ergodic theorem.
His article [Birk]
constitutes the
fundamental account
which  has
become a very extensive subject
dealing with  ergodic properties and
the search for invariant measures in different contexts.

\centerline{\bf{¤ 0. About the  spectral theorem for self-adjoint 
operators}}
\medskip

\noindent
A separable Hilbert space is isomorphic to $\ell^2$ whose vectors
are sequences of complex numbers
$\{x_p\}$ indexed by integers where
$\sum\, |x_p|^2<\infty$.
A doubly indexed sequence
$\{c_{pq}\}$ is Hermitian if:
\[
 c_{q,p}= \overline{c}_{p,q}
\]
We impose the condition that
each column of this infinite matrix belongs to $\ell^2$, i.e.
\[
\sum_{q=0}^\infty |c_{pq}|^2<\infty\quad\colon\, p=1,2,\ldots \tag{1}
\] 
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality entails that if
$x\in \ell^2$ then
the series
\[
\sum_{q=0}^\infty c_{p,q}\cdot x_q\tag{2}
\] 
converges absolutely for
each $p$ and let  $y_p$ denote the sum.
Condition (1) does not imply that
$\{y_p\}$ belongs to $\ell^2$.
So we  get a subspace $\mathcal D$ of $\ell^2$
which consists of vectors
$x$ such that
\[
\sum_{p=0}^\infty \, \bigl|\sum_{q=0}^\infty c_{p,q}\cdot x_q\bigr|^2<\infty\tag{3}
\]
If  $q$ is fixed  the Hermitian condition gives
\[
\sum_{p=0}^\infty  |c_{pq}|^2=
\sum_{p=0}^\infty  |c_{qp}|^2
\] 
and the last sum is finite by
(1). Hence 
$\mathcal D$ contains the $\ell^2$-vector $e_q$  where
$x_q=1$ while $x_\nu=0$ for $\nu\neq q$.
Taking linear combinations,
$\mathcal D$
contains the subspace $\ell^2_*$
of vectors $x$ for which $x_\nu\neq 0$ 
for a finite set of $\nu$.
Since $\ell_*^2$ is a dense subspace of
$\ell^2$ 
there exists the densely defined linear operator
$S$ which sends a vector $x$
to the vector $Sx=y$  where
\[ 
y_p=\sum_{q=0}^\infty  c_{qp}\cdot x_q\quad\colon p=0,1,2\ldots
\]
Thus, $\mathcal D$ is the space
of vectors $x\in \ell^2$ such that
$y\in \ell^2$.
Reversing the role between rows and columns
we get  the subspace $\mathcal D^*$ of vectors $y\in\ell^2$ for which
\[
\sum_{q=0}^\infty \, \bigl|\sum_{p=0}^\infty c_{p,q}\cdot y_p\bigr|^2<\infty\tag{4}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A pairing via inner products.}}
Let $y$ be a vector in $\mathcal D^*$.
For each $x\in\mathcal D$ we get the Hermitian inner product
\[
\langle Sx,y\rangle =\sum\sum\, c_{pq}x_q\bar y_p
\]
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality entails that
\[
|\langle Sx,y\rangle|^2\leq ||x||^2\cdot 
\sum_{q=0}^\infty \, \bigl|\sum_{p=0}^\infty c_{p,q}\cdot y_p\bigr|^2\tag{5}
\]
where $||x||^2=\sum\, |x_p|^2$ is the squared norm of the $\ell^2$-vector $x$.
This can be expressed by saying that if
$y\in\mathcal D^*$ then
the linear functional on $\mathcal D$ defined by
\[ 
x\mapsto \langle Sx,y\rangle
\]
has a norm bounded by the
square root of (4).
Since $\mathcal D$ is dense in $\ell^2$
and the Hilbert space $\ell^2$ is self-dual
this  gives a unique vector $y^*$ such that
\[
\langle Sx,y\rangle=\langle x,y^*\rangle
\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D\tag{6}
\]
Conversely, if $y$ is a vector in
$\ell^2$ for which there exists a vector $y^*$ as above
then one
varies $x$ in  $\ell^2_*$ and conclude that
$y\in \mathcal D^*$ where (4) is equal to $||y^*||^2$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The inclusion $\mathcal D\subset \mathcal D^*$.}}
let $\xi\in \mathcal D$. For every   $x\in \mathcal D$
we have
\[
\langle Sx,\xi\rangle=
\sum\sum c_{pq}x_q\bar\xi_p=
\sum\sum x_q\bar c_{qp}\bar\xi_p=
\langle x,S\xi\rangle
\]
This shows that
$\mathcal D\subset\mathcal D^*$ and one has the equality
\[
S\xi=\xi^*\quad\colon \xi\in\mathcal D\tag{7}
\]

\noindent Following Carleman we give

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Definition.}}
\emph{The Hermitian  matrix
$\{c_{pq}\}$
is of type I if one has the equality
$\mathcal D=\mathcal D^*$.}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
Suppose that the matrix is of type I and let $S$ be the 
densely defined linear operator above with
$\mathcal D(S)=\mathcal D$.
Let $\lambda=a+ib$ be a non-real complex number, i.e. $b\neq 0$
If  $x\in\mathcal D(S)$ we get
\[
||\lambda x-S||^2=
 \lambda x-Sx\rangle=||\lambda|^2||x||^2+||Sx||^2+
 \lambda\cdot \langle x,Sx\rangle+
  \bar \lambda\cdot \langle Sx,x\rangle\tag{i}
\]
Since   we are in Type I we have
\[
\lambda\cdot \langle x,Sx\rangle+
 \bar \lambda\cdot \langle Sx,x\rangle=(\lambda+\bar\lambda)\cdot
 \langle Sx,x\rangle= 2a\cdot  \langle Sx,x\rangle
\]
Hence the right hand side in (i) becomes
\[
b^2||x||^2+\bigl(\, a^2||x||^2+||Sx||^2+ 2a\cdot \langle Sx,x\rangle
 \,\bigr)
\]
Tbe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality entails that the sum inside the last bracket is
$\geq 0$ and taking a square root we get
the inequality
\[
||\lambda x-Sx||\geq |\mathfrak{Im}(\lambda)||\cdot ||x||\tag{ii}
\]
This inequality implies that
there cannot exist a non-zero $x$ in $\mathcal D(S)$
such that
\[ 
Sx=ix\tag{iii}
\]
In ¤ 5.3.1 we a construct Hermitian  matrix whose
associated $S$-operator has a non-zero eigenvector with
eigenvalue $i$. From the above it means that there exist
$c$-matrices where  Case I fails.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A sufficiency for Case I}}.
The condition in  the definition above is rather implicit.
The following  necessary and sufficient
condition i order that Case I occurs was established
[ibid]:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}} \emph{Case I holds for $S$ if and only if
the equations}
\[ 
Sx=ix\quad\colon Sx=-ix
\]
\emph{have no non-zero solutions $x\in\mathcal D(S)$.}




\medskip
\noindent
In most  applications one
uses this criterion to decide when
Case I holds. The proof is given in ¤ xx.



\bigskip


\centerline{\bf{0.1 Spectral resolutions.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Before Theorem ¤ 0.1.1 is announced
below we recall a  construction due to
Hilbert.
A resolution  of the identity on
$\ell^2$ consists of a 
family $\{E(\lambda)\}$
of self-adjoint projections, indexed by real numbers
$\lambda$  which satisfies  (A-C) below.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A}}. Each $E(\lambda)$ 
is an orthogonal projection from
$\ell^2$ onto the range $E(\lambda)(\ell^2)$ and 
these operators commute pairwise, i.e.
\[
E(\lambda)\cdot E(\mu)=
E(\mu)\cdot E(\lambda)\tag{i}
\]
hold for pairs of real numbers. Moreover, for each 
$x\in\ell^2$ one has 
\[ 
\lim_{\lambda+\infty}\,||E(\lambda)(x)-x||=0
\quad\colon
\lim_{\lambda\to -\infty}\,||E(\lambda)(x)||=0\tag{ii}
\] 

\noindent {\bf{B}}.
To each pair of real numbers
$a<b$ we set
\[ 
E_{a,b}= E(b)-E(a)
\]
Then
\[
E_{a,b}\cdot
E_{c,d}=0\tag{iii}
\] 
for each pair of disjoint interval
$[a,b]$ and $[b,c]$.

\medskip

\noindent {\bf{C}}.
Notice first that if $\mu<\lambda$ for a pair of real numbers
and $x\in\ell^2$ then
(ii) gives
\[
E(\mu)[E-E(\lambda)](x)=
\lim_{s\to+\infty}\, (E\mu)-E(-s))(E(s)-E(\lambda)(x)
\]
By (iii) the last product is zero as soon as
$s>\lambda$ and $-s<\mu$ and hence we have
\[
E(\mu)= E(\mu)E(\lambda)
\]
It means that the range $E(\mu)(\ell^2)$ increases with
$\mu$ and from this it is clear that
when  $x\in\ell^2$ then the real-valued function 
\[ 
\lambda\mapsto\langle E(\lambda)(x),x\rangle\tag{c}
\] 
is a real-valued and  non-decreasing function.
Hilbert's  last condition is that (c)
is right continuous for
every fixed 
$x$.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{$S$-adapted resolutions.}}
Let $S$ be a densely defined linear operator on
$\ell^2$.
A spectral resolution  $\{E(\lambda)\}$ of the identity
is $S$-adapted if the following  hold:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.1}} For each interval bounded $[a,b]$ the range of
$E_{a,b}$ is contained in $\mathcal D(S)$
 and the everywhere defined linear operator
 \[
 S_{a,b}= S\circ E_{a,b}
 \]
 is bounded and in addition
\[
E_{a,b}(Sx)=S_{a,b}(x)\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(S)
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{B.1 }} By (C)  each  $x\in\ell^2$
gives the non-decreasing function
$\lambda\mapsto\langle E(\lambda)(x),x\rangle$ on the  real line.
Together with the right continuity in (c) there exist
Stieltjes' integrals
\[
\int_a^b\, \lambda\cdot \langle dE(\lambda)(x),x\rangle
\] 
for each bounded interval.
The second condition for 
$\{E(\lambda)\}$  is that
a vector $x$ belongs to $\mathcal D(S)$ if and only if
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \, |\lambda|\cdot \langle dE(\lambda)(x),x\rangle<\infty\tag{b.1}
\] 


\noindent
{\bf{C.1}} The last  condition is that
\[
\langle Sx,y\rangle=
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \, \lambda\cdot \langle dE(\lambda)(x),y\rangle
\quad\colon x,y\in\mathcal D(S)\tag{c.1}
\]
where (b.1) and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
entail that the Stieltjes' integral in (c.1) is absolutely convergent.
\medskip


\noindent
Now we can announce a major result from
[Carleman].

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{0.1.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{Each Hermitian operator $S$ of type I has  a unique
adapted resolution of the identity.}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
For a bounded Hermitian operator the existence of
an adapted resolution of the identity  was proved by
Hilbert in 1904
whose pioneering work
was put forward
in Carleman's lecture at the IMU-congress in 1932:
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{La thorie, cre par Hilbert, des formes quadratiques (ou hermitiennes)
 une infinit de variables en connexion avec la thorie
des quations intgrales  noyeau symmetrique est certainement
la plus importante dcouverte qui ait t faite dans la
thorie des quations intgrales
aprs les travaux  fondamentaux de Fredholm.}
\medskip

\noindent
In practice a crucial  point
is 
to check when 
a densely defined symmetric operator
$S_*$ can be  extended to an operator $S$ of type I.
From the start $S_*$  need not be expressed by
a Hermitian matrix. The reason is that
on a separable Hilbert space 
many orthonormal bases exist.
So an important issue  in Carleman's work  was to find
sufficient conditions
in order that Type I extensions exist for  a given
symmetric operator, which from the start is not expressed by
a Hermitian  matrix.
The next section   gives a criterion
in order that symmetric integral operators are of  
Type I.

\centerline {\bf{0.2 Integral operators.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
Let $K(x,y)$ be a complex-valued Lebesgue measurable function
on the product of the unit interval $[0,1]$ which 
satisfies
$K(y,x)=\overline{K(x,y)}$ and
there exists a null set $\mathcal N$ in 
$[0,1]$ such that
\[
\int_0^1\, |K(x,y)|^2\, dy<\infty\quad\colon x\in
 [0,1]\setminus\mathcal N\tag{*}
 \]
 This gives a non-decreasing
 sequence  of measurable set
 $\{E_1,E_2,\ldots\}$ whose union is 
 $[0,1]\setminus\mathcal N$ and 
 \[
\int_0^1\, |K(x,y)|^2\, dy\leq n \quad\colon x\in E_n\tag{1}
\]
To each $n$ we define the truncated kernel $K_n(x,y)$ which is equal to $K(x,y)$
if both $x$ and $y$ belong to $E_n$, and is otherwise zero.
Here (1) gives
 \[
\iint_{[0,1]\times [0,1]}
\, |K_n(x,y)|^2\, dxdy\leq n \tag{2}
\]
Hence each $K_n$ yields a Hilbert-Schmidt operator
on the Hilbert space $\mathcal H= L^2[0,1]$.
Since $K_n(y,x)= \overline{K_n(x,y)}$
the spectrum of the associated integral operator
is real.
In particular, if $\mathfrak{Im}(\lambda)\neq 0$
and $f\in  \mathcal H$  there exists a unique
$\phi_n\in \mathcal H$ such that
\[
\phi_n(x)= \lambda\cdot \int_0^1\, K_n(x,y)\cdot \phi_n(y)\, dy+f(x)\tag{3}
\]
By a similar reasoning as in the remark from ¤ 0.0
one has
\[
||\phi_n||_2\leq  \frac{1}{|\mathfrak{Im}(\lambda)|}\cdot ||f||_2
\tag{4}
\]
Starting from this, Carleman applied 
results from 
the
article \emph{ber Systeme integrierbarer Funktionen} [Math. Annalen 1910]
by F. Riesz.
This gives the existence of at least one 
subsequence
$\{\psi_\nu=\phi_{n_\nu}\}$
which converges weakly to an $L^2$-function $\psi$, i.e.
\[ 
\lim_{\nu\to \infty}\, \int_0^1\, \psi_\nu\cdot g\, dx=
 \int_0^1\, \psi\cdot g\, dx
 \]
hold for every $g\in \mathcal H$.
Now (2) and the weak convergence entail that
\[
\psi(x)= \lambda\cdot \int_0^1\, K_n(x,y)\cdot \psi(y)\, dy+f(x)\tag{*}
\]
Hence (*)
has a solution for
every pair $f\in\mathcal H$ and  non-real $\lambda$.
The solution $\psi$ was found via a weakly convergent sequence
and there reamins to analyze
if it is 
unique. To ensure this we   impose the condition that
the homogeneous equation
\[
\phi(x)= \lambda\cdot \int_0^1\, K_n(x,y)\cdot \phi(y)\, dy\tag{**}
\]
has no non-zero solution $\phi\in \mathcal H$
when $\lambda$ is non-real. In addition Carleman 
imposed the similar condition for the adjoint equation:
\[
\psi(x)= \lambda\cdot \int_0^1\, K_n(x,y)\cdot \psi(y)\, dy\implies \psi=0\tag{***}
\]
When (**-***) hold
it is proved in [1923] 
that
the spectral measures associated to the Hilbert-Schmidt kernels $\{K_n\}$
converge and give an adapted spectral resolution of the densely defined
integral operator $K$.
Let us also remark that
(**-**) is generic in the sense that it suffices to
be satisfied when
$\lambda$ is any given non-real complex number.
For example one can take
$\lambda=i$
to check if (**-***) holds or not.
An example of a symmetric and densely defined
kernel function $K(x,y)$
where (**-***)  fails is given in ¤ xx.
Let us finish 
by
some other examples which 
illustrate 
phenomena
which can occur for 
unbounded integral operators.

\bigskip









\centerline {\bf{0.2.1 Some examples.}}
\medskip



\noindent
{\bf{Picard's equation.}}
Here one takes $K(x,y)= e^{-|x-y|}$ on
the product of the real line.
For a complex number $\lambda$ one seeks
functions $\phi$  such that
\[
\phi(x)=\lambda\cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty\, 
e^{-|x-y|}\cdot \phi(y)\, dy\tag{1}
\]

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that for every real number
$\alpha$ the exponential function
$e^{i\alpha x}$ solves (1) with the eigenvalue
\[
\lambda=\frac{1+\alpha^2}{2}
\]
Hence the spectrum of Picard's operator
contains the real half-line $[1/2,+\infty)$.
Notice that we employ eigenfunctions which
are bounded but no in $L^2({\bf{R}})$.
So Picard's integral operator  is not  confined to
$L^2$-spaces. The reason is 
that the exponential decay of the kernel  allows
an extensive family  of functions for which
the convolution integral in the right hand side converges.

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Weyl's equation.}}
Here one seeks functions $\phi$ such that
\[ 
\phi(x)= \lambda\cdot \int_0^\infty\, 
\sin(xy)\cdot \phi(y)\, dy
\]
In this case the special eigenvalue $\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}$
yields an \emph{infinite} family of eigenfunctions
of the form
\[ 
\phi(x)=\frac{x}{x^2+a^2}+\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\cdot e^{-ax}
\quad\colon a>+0
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The kernel $K(z,\zeta)= \frac{1}{(1-z\bar\zeta)^2}$.}}
Let $z$ and $\zeta$ be complex numbers
and $D$ the unit disc.
If $g(z)$ is square integrable in
$D$
we set
\[
\mathcal K_g(z)=\frac{1}{\pi}\cdot \int_D\,  \frac{1}{(1-z\bar\zeta)^2}\cdot g(\zeta)\, d\xi d\eta
\]
It is clear that $\mathcal K_g(z)$ is an analytic function in
$D$. Moreover, if $g(z)$ is analytic in $D$
then
the reader may verify that
\[
\mathcal K_g(z)= g(z)
\]
This means that
$\mathcal K_g$ is a projection from
$L^2(D)$ onto the subspace $H^2(D)$ of square integrable and
analytic functions.
So $H^2(D)$ is the eigenspace 
for the eigenvalue  $\lambda= \pi^{-1}$
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that $\pi^{-1}$ is the sole eigenvalue,  i.e.
\[
g\mapsto \mathcal K_g-\lambda\cdot g
\]
is injective on $L^2(D)$ for 
every $\lambda\neq \pi^{-1}$.
Show also the ineuality below
for every $g\in L^2(D)$:
\[
\frac{1}{\pi}\cdot \iint_{D\times D}\, 
\frac{1}{(1-z\bar\zeta)^2}\cdot \bar g(z)\cdot
g(\zeta)\, d\xi d\eta dxdy\leq \int_D\, |g(z)|^2\, dxdy
\]
with equality if and only if $g$ is analytic in $D$.
Hence analytic functions in $D$ are characterized by
an extremal property
of weighted integrals via the kernel function $K$.

\newpage

\centerline{\bf{¤ 0.3 The Schrdinger equation.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
In  1923 Carleman was  concerned with
extensions of Fredholm's theory to 
unbounded
kernels in connection with boundary value problems.
Two years later it turned out that the  theory in [ibid]
could be applied to 
the "new-born" quantum mechanics !
In a lecture at the Scandinavian  congess in mathematics
held at Copenhagen in 1925, Niels Bohr
talked about  quantum mechanics
and  adressed new problems for the 
mathematical communtity where
the following second order PDE-equation plays a crucial role:
\[ 
\Delta\phi+2m\cdot\bigl( E-U\bigr)\bigl(\frac{2\pi}{h}\bigr)^2\cdot \phi=0\tag{*}
\] 
Here $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator in the 3-dimensional $(x,y,z)$-space,
$m$ the mass of a particle and $h$  Planck's constant
while   $U(x,y,z)$ is a potential function.
Finally $E$ is a parameter and one seeks values on $E$
such that (*) has a solution $\phi$
which belongs to $L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$.
Recall  that the fundamental point in Schrdinger's theory
is the hypothesis on energy levels which correspond to 
orbits in Bohr's theory of atoms. 
For further physical  background
the  reader should
consult 
Bohr's  
plenary talk when 
he received the Nobel Prize in physics 1923,
as well as Schrdinger's plenary tal in 1932.
Leaving physics aside, the  mathematical problem
amounts to study   second order
PDE-operators:
\[ 
L=\Delta+c(x,y,z)\quad\colon
\Delta=\partial_x^2+\partial_y^2+\partial_z^2\tag{*}
\]
where $c(x,y,z)$ is a real-valued function
which is almost everywhere continuous in the sense of Lebesgue,
and in addition locally square integrable in
${\bf{R}}^3$. Consider the Hilbert space
$\mathcal H=L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$ where
the $L$-operator is   defined on the
dense subspace of 
test-functions  in
${\bf{R}}^3$. 
Greens' formula entails that it is symmetric, i.e. for each pair $f,g$ in
$C_0^\infty({\bf{R}}^3)$ one has:
\[
\iint\, L(f)\cdot g\, dxdydz=
\iint\, L(g)\cdot f\, dxdydz
\]
A major problem is
to decide if there
exists 
a subspace $\mathcal H_*$ of $\mathcal H$
which contains the 
test-functions and has  the property   that
$f\in \mathcal H_*$  entails that $L(f)\in
L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$ where    symmetry persists:
\[
\iint\, L(f)\cdot g\, dxdydz=
\iint\, L(g)\cdot f\, dxdydz\quad\colon f,g\in\mathcal H_*
\]
Moreover, $L^2$-functions 
$\phi\in \mathcal H_*$
are characterized by the property that there
exists a constant $C(\phi)$ such that
\[
\bigl|\iint\, L(f)\cdot g\, dxdydz\,\bigr|\leq
||f||_2\quad\colon f\in C_0^\infty({|bf{R}}^3)
\]
where
$||f||_2$ is the $L^2$-norm.
In general such   extensions  of densely defined symmetric operators
do not exist. A  counter-example is described in ¤ 5.3.
But with $L$  as in  (*) 
the following sufficiency result is proved in 
Carleman's   article
\emph{Sur la thorie mathmatique de l'quation de Schrdinger}
[Arkiv fr math. 1934] whose proof is given in ¤ 6.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem }}
\emph{The  subspace  $\mathcal H_*$ 
exists if there is a  constant $M$
such that}
\[
\limsup_{x^2+y^2+z^2\to \infty}\, c(x,y,z)\leq M
\]




\noindent{{\bf{Example.}}
In physical  applications one is foremost concerned with  the
case
when $c$ is  a potential function
\[ 
W(p)=\sum\,\frac{\alpha_k}{|p-q_k|}+\beta
\] 
where $\{q_k\}$ is a finite subset of
${\bf{R}}^3$  and  $\{\alpha_k\}$ and 
$\beta$ are real and positive numbers. For this special $c$-function
Carleman  solved   the problem raised by Bohr and Schrdinger
in   his  lectures  \emph{La thorie des quations intgrales singulires}
held at Institut Poincar in 1930. The solution is quite direct and
one does not need the more involved result in the theorem above.
Namely,
for each  $\kappa>0$ we 
define a function $H(p,q)$ in ${\bf{R}}^3\times
{\bf{R}}^3$ by
\[
H(p,q)= \frac{e^{-|\kappa|p-q|}}{|p-q|}
\] 
where
$|p-q|$ is the euclidian distance between
a pair of points in
${\bf{R}}^3$.
Choose $\kappa$ so large that the volume integrals
\[
\iiint \, H(p,q)\cdot W(q)\, dq <4\pi\tag{i}
\]
for every $p\in {\bf{R}}^3$.
From now on $\kappa$ is fixed so that (i) holds.
Set
\[
\Omega(p,q)=\sqrt{W(p)}\cdot H(p,q)\cdot \sqrt{W(q)}\tag{ii}
\]
By (i) we find a positive constant $k<4\pi$ such that
\[
\iiint \, \Omega (p,q)\cdot \sqrt{W(q)}\, dq 
\leq k\cdot \sqrt{W(p)}\tag{iii}
\]
for every $p$ in ${\bf{R}}^3$.
This entails that
the integral operator on $\mathcal H$ defined by
\[ 
g\mapsto T_g(p)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\cdot \iiint \, \Omega(p,q)\cdot g(q)\, dq
\]
has operator norm
$\leq \frac{k}{4\pi}<1$.
Hence Neumann's resolvent  series gives a unique solution
$L(p,q)$ to the integral equation
\[
L(p,q)=\frac{1}{4\pi}
\iiint \, \Omega(p,x)\cdot L(p,x)\, dx+\Omega(p,q)\tag{iv}
 \]
Set
\[ 
G(p,q)=\frac{L(p,q)}{\sqrt{W(p)W(q)}}
\]

\noindent
From the above the $G$-kernel  gives a bounded and  compact 
linear operator on
$\mathcal H$ defined by
\[ 
g\mapsto\iiint \, G(p,q)\cdot g(q)\, dq
\]


\noindent
Hilbert's theory for bounded self-adjoint operators 
implies that non-zero solutions $\psi\in\mathcal H$
to 
the  equation
\[
\psi(p)=\frac{\lambda+\kappa^2}{4\pi}
\cdot \iiint  G(p,q)\cdot \psi(q)\,dq\tag{v}
\]
only exist  for positive real numbers
$\lambda$ which form a discrete sequence tending
to $+\infty$.
Finally, using 
and  Greens formula, one verifies that solutions 
in (v) are in a 1-1 correspondence
to $\phi$-functions satisfying
\[
\Delta(\phi)+(W+\lambda)\phi=  0\tag{vi}
\]



\noindent
{\bf{Conclusion.}}
From the above  the densely defined operator $L=\Delta+W$
has a self-adjoint extension to $\mathcal H$ and 
for each complex number
$\lambda$ outside the discrete real spectrum above
the inhomogeneous equation
\[
\Delta(\phi)+(W+\lambda)\phi=f
\] 
has a unique solution $\phi\in\mathcal H$ for every
$f\in\mathcal H$.

\bigskip
\centerline{\bf{¤ 0.3.1 The equation $\Delta(u)- c(p)u=i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$}}




\bigskip

\noindent
Let  $p=(x,y,z)$ denote  points in
${\bf{R}}^3$.
We seek functions $u=u(p,t)=u(x,y,z,t)$ of three real variables satisfying
the PDE-equation above where $c(p)$ is a real-valued function
which at least is locally square integrable.
Under the condition that the densely defined operator
$\Delta-c$ has a self-adjoint extension with a spectrum
confined to $[\ell,+\infty)$ for some
$\ell>0$ one finds a spectral  function
$\theta(p,q,\lambda)$ such that 
if $\in L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$
then the  function
\[
u(p,t)=\int_{{\bf{R}}^2}\int_\ell^\infty e^{i\lambda t}\cdot
 \frac{d}{d\lambda}(\theta(p,q,\lambda)\cdot f(q)\, dq
\]
satisfies the PDE-equation above with the inital condition $u(p,0)= f(p)$.
The main issue is to find expressions for
\[
\theta(p,q;\lambda+\lambda_1)-\theta(p,q;\lambda)\tag{0.1.0}
\] 
for pairs $\lambda\geq \ell$ and $\lambda_1>0$.
To attain this one introduces the associated Greens function
which satisfies the equation
\[ 
G(p,q;\lambda)-G(p,q;0)=4\pi\lambda\cdot \int_\ell^\infty\,
\frac{1}{\mu(\mu-\lambda)}
 \frac{d}{d\mu}(\theta(p,q,\mu)
\]
Passing to Dirichlet series, residue calculus entails
that the equation below hold for complex numbers
$s$ whose real part is sufficiently large and each $0<a<\ell$:
\[
\int_\ell^\infty\,  \frac{d}{d\mu}(\theta(p,q,\mu)\cdot \mu^{-s}\, d\mu=
\frac{1}{8\pi^2i}\cdot
\int_{a-i\infty}^{a+i\infty}\,[G(p,q;\lambda)-G(p,q;0)]\cdot \lambda^{-s}\, d\lambda
\]

\medskip

\noindent{\bf{The Neumann-Poincar series for $G$.}}
For each $\kappa>0$ we set
\[
 K(p,q;-\kappa)=\frac{e^{-\sqrt{\kappa}[p-q|}}{|p-q|}
\]
Inductively we define functions $K^{(n)}(p,q;-\kappa)$ by

\[
K^{(n+1)}(p,q;-\kappa)=
\int_{{\bf{R}}^2} \, K^{(n)}(p,\xi ;-\kappa)\cdot c(\xi)K(\xi,q;-\kappa)\, d\xi
\quad\colon n=1,2,\dots 
\]
With these notations one has
the Neumann-Poincar equation
\[ 
G(p,q;-\kappa)=K(p,q;-\kappa)+
\sum_{n=1}^\infty\, \frac{(-1)^n}{(4\pi)^n}
\cdot K^{(n)}(p,q;-\kappa)
\]
Using this and  complex contour integrals
similar to those which occur in (0.4.2)  below, one
finds (at least formally) an expansion of the differences in (0.1.0)
which goes as follows:
With  fixed pair $(\lambda,\lambda_1)$ as in (0.1.0) we set
\[
J(p,q)=
 \frac{1}{4\pi^2}
 \int_\lambda^{\lambda+\lambda_1}\,
\frac {\sin(\sqrt{x}\cdot |p-q|)}{|p-q|}\, dx
\]
\medskip


\noindent
\[
 J^{(1)}(p,q)=
-\frac{1}{16\pi^2} \int_\lambda^{\lambda+\lambda_1}
\,\bigl[\, \int_{{\bf{R}}^2}\,
\frac {\sin(\sqrt{x}\cdot |p-\xi|+|\xi-q|)}{|p-\xi|+|\xi-q|}\cdot c(\xi)\, d\xi \bigr]\, dx
\]
If $n\geq 2$ one has

\[
J^{(n)}(p,q)=
\]
\[
\frac{(-1)^n}{(4\pi)^{n+1}} 
\cdot 
 \int_\lambda^{\lambda+\lambda_1}\int_{{\bf{R}}^{n}}\,
\frac {\sin(\sqrt{x}\cdot |p-\xi_1|+|\xi_1-\xi_2|+
\ldots+|\xi_n-q|)}
{|p-\xi_1|+|\xi_1-\xi_2|+\dots+|\xi_n-q|}\, \cdot c(\xi_1)
\cdots c(\xi_n)\, d\xi_1\ldots d\xi_n  dx
\]

\medskip

\noindent
With these notations one has a formal expansion
\[
\theta(p,q;\lambda+\lambda_1)-\theta(p,q;\lambda)
=J(p,q)+J^{(1)}(p,q)+\ldots
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
At the end of the article [xx] Carleman  raises the question
to what extent the formal $J$-sum
gives
an asymptotic series for
the left hand side.
I do not know if more recent work
provides extra information  about  this question. In any case 
it is tempting
to
analyze
the expansion numerically
for given $c$-functions.

\centerline{\bf{¤ 0.4 The Laplace operator in the complex domain.}}

\bigskip



\noindent
Tbe flavour about densely defined and self-adjoint operators
on Hilbert spaces is illustrated by
the Laplace operator
$\Delta=\partial_x^2+\partial_y^2$ and
the Hilbert space
$L^2(D)$ of square integrable 
complex valued functions
in the unit disc $D=\{x^2+y^2<1\}$.
A dense subspace of $L^2(D)$ consists of test-functions
$f\in C_0^\infty(D)$ which 
gives the densely defined operator on
$L^2(D)$ defined by
\[
f\mapsto \Delta(f)
\]
By Green's formula the following holds
for each pair of test-functions:
\[
\langle \Delta(f),g\rangle=
\iint_D\, \Delta(f)\cdot \bar g\, dxdy=
\iint_D\, f\cdot \overline{\Delta(g)}\, dxdy=
\langle f,\Delta(g)\rangle
\]
The question arises if we can extend 
the domain of definition of $\Delta$ to a larger subspace 
$\mathcal D$ of
$L^2(D)$ where the symmetry
above holds for pairs $f,g$ in $\mathcal D$.
It turns out that a specific
choice of $\mathcal D$ exists.
Namely,  introduce the
bounded linear operator $\mathcal L$ on
$L^2(D)$ defined by
\[
\mathcal L(f)(p)=
\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \iint_D\, L(p,q)\cdot f(q)\, dq
\]
where points in $D$ are denoted by $p$ and $q$ so that
$dq=dxdy$ and
\[
L(p,q)= \log\, \frac{|p-q|}{1-\bar qp|}
\]
It is easily seen that
$\mathcal L$ sends each
$f\in L^2(D)$ to a continuous function which is zero on
$\partial D$.
Next, recall that
$\frac{1}{2\pi}\log\,|z|$ is a fundamental  solution to
the Laplace operator. From this one easily shows that
\[
\Delta(\mathcal L(f))= f
\quad \colon f\in L^2(D)
\]
So if the domain of definition for
$\Delta$
is taken as the range of $\mathcal L$, then the composed operator
\[ 
\Delta\circ \mathcal L=E\tag{*}
\] 
where $E$ is the identity operator on $L^2(D)$.
It turns out that this is "optimal choice" of
$\mathcal D$
yields a densely defined  self-adjoint operator.
The crucial fact is the
following:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}
\emph{A function $g\in L^2(D)$  belongs to the range of
$\mathcal L$ if and only if there exists a constant
$C(g)$ such that}
\[
|\langle \Delta(f),g\rangle|=
\bigl|\iint_D\, \Delta(f)\cdot \bar g\, dxdy\,\bigr|\leq C(g)\cdot ||f||_2
\quad\colon f\in \mathcal L(L^2(D))
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
Notice that ordinary harmonic functions "disappear"
above. The reason is that
if
we take a function $g=\mathcal L(f)$
then $g$  is zero on
$\partial D$ so by the maximum principle for harmonic functions
it cannot satisfy
$\Delta(g)=0$ in the open disc.
Moreover (*) means that $\Delta$ yields a \emph{bijective} map from
$\mathcal L(L^2(D))$ to $L^2(D)$.
In ¤ 1 we shall learn that
$\mathcal L$ is Neumann's resolvent of the densely defined
operator $\Delta$.
Tbe spectrum of the unbounded
operator
$\Delta$ consists of a non-decreasing
sequence of real numbers
$\{0<\lambda_0\leq \lambda_1\leq \ldots\}$
where one for each $n$ has  an eigenfunction $\phi_n$
in the range of $\mathcal L$ with unit $L^2$-norm such that
\[ 
\Delta(\phi_n)+\lambda\cdot \phi_n=0
\]
A crucial point is that these eigenvalues and corresponding
eigenfunctions
are equally well  found via the
compact  operator  $\mathcal L$ on $L^2(D)$
whose
spectrum is the discrete set
$\{-\frac{1}{\lambda_n}\}$
with a sole cluster point at
$\{\lambda=0\}$  and
here
\[
\mathcal L(\phi_n)=-\frac{1}{\lambda_n} \cdot \phi_n
\]
The lesson from this  example
which stems  from
work by Poincar,  is that
the study of the unbounded
$\Delta$-operator can be recovered via
the compact operator $\mathcal L$ 
on
$L^2(D)$.
The reader should keep this example in mind
while the
general theory about unbounded
self-adjoint operators is presented.
\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{Further comments.}}
In view of the fundaemtnal character of the example above
we insert some
further
remarks related to the theorem above
where we constructed the operator $\mathcal L$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Verify that for each
$\phi\in L^2(D)$, 
$\mathcal L(\phi)$ is a continuous function in
$D$ which vanishes on the boundary
$T=\{|z|=1\}$ and show 
the equality
\[ 
\Delta(\mathcal L(\phi))=\phi\tag{i}
\]
where the left hand side is the Laplacian of
$\mathcal L(\phi)$ 
taken in the distribution sense.
\medskip

\noindent
By (i)  the restriction of $\Delta$ to the range of $\mathcal L$
gives a linear operator with values in
$L^2(D)$.
Identifying
$\mathcal L(L^2(D))$ with a subspace of
$L^2(D)$, this  means that
we have constructed a densely defined
operator $A$ where 
$\mathcal D(A)=
 \mathcal L(L^2(D))$ and one has   a
surjective map
\[ 
A\colon\mathcal D(A)\to L^2(D)\tag{ii}
\]
Notice that  
\[
\mathcal L\circ A(\mathcal L(\phi))=\mathcal L(\phi)
\quad\colon \phi\in L^2(D)\tag{iii}
\]
Hence the composed operator
$\mathcal L\circ A$ is the identity  on
$\mathcal D(A)$ which means 
that $\mathcal L$ is Neumann's inverse
sense
to the densely defined
operator $A$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1. The adjoint $A^*$}}.
To each pair $u,v$ in $L^2(D)$
we set
$\phi=\mathcal L(u)$ and $\psi=\mathcal L(v)$
and
take  the inner product in
the Hilbert space
$L^2(D)$. This gives
\[
 \langle\, A(\phi),\psi\rangle=
 \int_D\, u(p)\cdot 
 \overline{\mathcal L(v)(p)}\, dp=
 \iint_{D\times D}\, u(p)\cdot L(p,q)\cdot \overline{v(q)}\, dpdq\tag{1.1}
\]  
where we have put
\[ 
L(p,q)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot 
\log \frac{|p-q|}{1-\overline{p} q|}
\]
Fubini's theorem entails that
the last term in (1.1) is equal to
 $\langle\phi,A(\psi)\rangle$ which  
proves the symmetry
\[
 \langle\, A(\phi),\psi\rangle=\langle\phi,A(\psi)\rangle
\quad\colon \phi,\psi\in\mathcal D(A)\tag{1.2}
\]
Next,  the construction of adjoints
gives  the linear operator $\mathcal D(A^*)$ whose domain of definition
consists of $L^2(D)$-functions $g$ for which there
exists a constant $C(g)$ such that
\[
|\langle\, A(\phi),g\rangle|\leq C(g)\cdot ||\phi||_2
\quad\colon \phi\in\mathcal D(A)\tag{1.3}
\]
By the construction of $\mathcal D(A)$
this means that
\[
 \iint_{D\times D}\, u(p)\cdot L(p,q)\cdot \overline{g(q)}\, dpdq
 \leq C(g)\cdot
 ||\mathcal L(u)||_2\quad\colon u\in L^2(D)\tag{1.4}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Using the symmetry of $L(p,q)$ to show that 
(1.4) holds if and only if $g$ belongs to
the range of $\mathcal L$. Hence
$\mathcal D(A^*)=\mathcal D(A)$
which means   that $A$ is a densely defined and self-adjoint operator.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2. The spectrum of $A$.}}
Neumann's construction of spectra associated to
densely defined operators presented in ¤ 0 yields
a closed set $\sigma(A)$.
From the above $\mathcal L$ is an inverse to $A$ so
$\lambda=0$ is outside the spectrum.
It turns out that
$\sigma(A)$ is a real and discrete set.
Given a real $\lambda$ the operator
$\lambda\cdot E-A$
fails to be injective
if
we find a real-valued function
$\phi \in \mathcal D(A)$ such that
\[
\Delta(\phi)=
\lambda\cdot\phi\tag{2.1}
\]


\noindent
Each eigenvalue $\lambda$ is  strictly negative. For suppose that
(2.1) holds
with
$\lambda>0$.
Since $\phi\in\mathcal D(A)$ it is a continous function which is not identically zero
and
replacing $\phi$ by $-\phi$
if necessary we may assume that the maximum is $>0$ and taken at some point $p\in D$.
A Taylor expansion of $\phi$ at $p$ gives 
$\Delta(\phi)(p)\leq 0$ which contradicts (2.1) when
$\lambda>0$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
One sometimes rewrites the eigenvalues and make  the assertion that
\[
\phi\mapsto \Delta(\phi)+\lambda\cdot \phi\tag{*}
\]
is injective with the exclusion of
a discrete set $\{\lambda_n\}$
of positive real numbers.
To get a \emph{lower bound} for positive $\lambda$ where
(*) has a non-zero solution
one employs Green's formula which  entails that
\[
\int_D\Delta(\phi)\cdot \phi\,dxdy=
-\int_D\,(\phi_x^2+\phi_y^2)\cdot \phi\,dxdy
\]
It follows that
\[
\lambda\cdot \int\, \phi^2\, dxdy=\int_D\,(\phi_x^2+\phi_y^2))\cdot \phi\,dxdy
\] 
Since $\phi=0$ on the boundary of $D$,
the Dirichlet integral in
the right hand side majorises the
squared  $L^2$-norm of $\phi$ by an absolute constant $c>0$, i.e.
\[
\int\, \phi^2\, dxdy\leq c\cdot \int_D\,(\phi_x^2+\phi_y^2))\cdot \phi\,dxdy\tag{**}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}} Find the smallest $c$ for which (**)  holds and consult 
the literature
for
a description of the eigenvalues of $A$ and the corresponding
eigenfunctions.


\bigskip

\centerline{\bf{0.4.1 The operator $\Delta+c(x,y)$}}.
\medskip

\noindent
A real-valued function $c\in L^2(D)$
gives the densely defined  operator
$P=\Delta+c$.
We seek a domain of definition which entails that
$P$ is self-adjoint.
To attain this we introduce the  kernel function:
\[
R(p,q)= L(p,q)\cdot c(q)
\]

\noindent
Keeping $p$ fixed we notice that the Cauchy-Schearz ineqwuality entials that
the $L^1$-integral of
\[
 q\mapsto L(p,q)\cdot c(q)
\] 
is finite.
So if $g$ is a continuous function with compact support in
$D$
we get the function
\[ 
p\mapsto \mathcal R(g)(p)= \int_D\, L(p,q)\cdot c(q)\cdot g(q)\, dq
\]
Next, let $\psi(p)\in L^2(D)$. Since $L(p,q)$ is a hiolbert-Schmidt kernel
there exists a constant $C$ such that 
\[
\max_{q\in D}\, \int_D\, |\psi(p)L(p,q)|\, dp\leq
C\cdot ||\psi||_2
\]
Then Fubini's theorem and
the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality 
give
\[
|\langle\psi,\mathcal R(g)\rangle|\leq
C\cdot ||\psi||_2\cdot ||c||_2\cdot ||g||_2
\]
This entails that $\mathcal R$ extends to
a bounded linear operator on $L^2(D)$ whose operator norm
is $\leq C\cdot ||c||_2$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{ Exercise.}}
Above $\mathcal R=\mathcal R_c$
depends upon $c$.
Show that if $c$ from the start is a test function in $D$, then
 $\mathcal R_c$ is a compact operator. Use that
 a linear operator which can be apprximated by compact operators in
 the operator norm
  also is compact and conclude from the
  density of
  $C_0^\infty(D)$ in $L^2(D)$ that $R_c$ is a compact operator on
  $L^2(D)$ for every $c\in L^2(D)$.
 \bigskip
 
 \noindent
{\bf{The equation $P(g)=f$.}}
Keeping $c$ fixed we set $\mathcal R=\mathcal R_c$É
If  $g\in L^2(D)$ is such that
$c\cdot g\in L^2(D)$
we have
\[ 
\mathcal R(g)=\int L(p,q)c(q)g(q)\, dq= \mathcal L(cg)
\]
It follows from the previous section that
\[
\Delta( \mathcal R(g))= cg\tag{i}
\]
Hence
\[ 
P(g)=\Delta \circ(E+\mathcal R)(g)\tag{ii}
\]
Let us then
consider  the inhomogenous equation
\[
P(g)=f
\]
If the linear operator
$E+\mathcal R$ has an inverse we
set
\[
g=(E+\mathcal R)^{-1}\circ\mathcal L(f)\tag{iii}
\]
Then (ii-iii) give
\[
P(g)=
\Delta\circ\mathcal L(f)=f
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{ A self-adjoint operator.}}
If $g$ belongs to the range of
$\mathcal L$
we have seen that it is a continuous function which is zro on
$\partial D$. It follows that
$c\cdot g$ stays in $L^2(D)$ and hence
there exists  the densely defined operator
\[
g\mapsto P(g)\quad \colon g\in \mathcal L(L^2(D))
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Shows that with $\mathcal D(P)$ tsken as
the range of $\mathcal L$, it follows that
one has a self-adjoint operator whose spectrum is
a discrete subset of the real $\lambda$-line.
Concerning the points  in the spetrum
$\sigma(P)$ and the associated eigenfunctions they
depend upon $c$ and 
here one is obliged to
perform numerical calculations to
get further information.

\centerline{\bf{¤ 0.4.2 The $\Delta$-operator on general domains.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
Above we considered the unit disc. More generally, let
$\Omega$ be a bounded and connected domain in
${\bf{C}}$
whose boundary consists of a finite number of
pairwise disjoint and differentiable closed Jordan curves.
It is wellknown that the Dirichlet problem is solvable  for
such domains.
In particular, let $p\in\Omega$
be kept fixed
and consider the continuous function on
$\partial\Omega$ defined by
\[ 
q\mapsto  \log \frac{1}{|p-q|}
\]
We find the harmonic function
$u_p(q)$ in $\Omega$ such that
$u_p(q)=\log \frac{1}{|p-q|}\,\colon\, q\in\partial\Omega$.
Green's function is defined for pairs $p\neq q$ in
$\Omega\times\Omega$ 
by
\[ 
G(p,q)= \log\,\frac{1}{|p-q|}-u_p(q)\tag{1}
\]
This entails that
if $p\in\Omega$ is kept fixed, then
$q\mapsto G(p,q)$ extends to the 
closure of $\Omega$ where it vanishes if
$q\in\partial\Omega$.
If  $f\in L^2(\Omega$
we set
\[ 
\mathcal G_f(p)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \int_\Omega\, G(p,q)\cdot f(q)\, dq\tag{2}
\]
where $q=(x,y)$ so that $dq=dxdy$ when the double integral is evaluated.
It is easily seen that
\[
 \iint_{\Omega\times \Omega}\, |G(p,q)|^2\, dpdq<\infty
\]
Hence
$\mathcal G$ is of the Hilbert-Schmidt type and
therefore a compact operator on 
$L^2(\Omega)$.
Next,  recall that
$\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \log\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is
a fundamental solution to the Laplace operator.
From this one can deduce the following:

\medskip

\noindent{\bf{0.4.2.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{For each $f\in L^2(\Omega)$
the Lapacian of $\mathcal G_f$
taken in the distribution sense belongs to
$L^2(\Omega)$ and one has the equality}
\[ 
\Delta(\mathcal G_f)=-f\tag{*}
\] 
\medskip


\noindent
The equation (*) means that
the composed operator
$\Delta\circ \mathcal G$ is minus the identity on
$L^2(\Omega)$.
We are theorefore led
to introduce the 
linear operator $S$ on $L^2(\Omega)$ 
defined by $\Delta$, where  its domain of definition
$\mathcal D(S)$ is
the range of $\mathcal G$.
If $g\in C^2_0(\Omega)$, i.e. twice differentiable and with
compact support, it follows via Greens' formula that
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \int_\Omega\, G(p,q)\cdot \Delta(g)(q)\, dq=-g(p)
\]
In particular $C_0^2(\Omega)\subset\mathcal D(S)$
which  implies that
$S$ is densely defined and we  leave it to the reader to verify that
\[
\mathcal G(\Delta(f))=-f\quad\colon f\in\mathcal D(S)
\]


\medskip
\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
By the construction of resolvent operators in ¤ 1 this means that
$-\mathcal G$ is Neumann's inverse  of 
$S$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}} Show that $S$ has a closed range and in addition it
is self-adjoint, i.e. $S=S^*$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The spectrum of $S$.}}
A wellknown  result 
asserts that there exists an orthonormal basis $\{\phi_n\}$ in $L^2(\Omega)$
where each $\phi_n\in\mathcal D(S)$ is an eigenfunction. More preciesely
there is a non-decreasing sequence of positive real numbers
$\{\lambda_n\}$ and
\[ 
\Delta(\phi_n)+\lambda_n\cdot \phi_n=0\quad\colon n=1,2,\ldots\tag{i}
\]
Let us remark that (i) means that
\[
\mathcal G(\phi_n)= \frac{1}{\lambda_n}\, \cdot \phi_n\tag{ii}
\]
So above
$\{\lambda_n^{-1}\}$
are  eigenvalues of the compact operator $\mathcal G$ whose sole cluster
point is $\lambda=0$.
Eigenvalues whose eigenspaces have
dimension $e>1$ are repeated $e$ times.
Now we announce
a result about the values taken by the eigenfunctions.



\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{0.4.2.2 Theorem.}}
\emph{For each point $p\in\Omega$ one has the limit formula}
\[
\lim_{n\to \infty}\, \frac{1}{\lambda_n}\cdot
\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\, \phi_k(p)^2=
 \frac{1}{4\pi}\tag{*}
 \]
 \medskip
 
 
 \noindent
To prove this we  consider the Dirichlet series
for each fixed $p\in\Omega$:
\[ 
\Phi_p(s)=\sum _{n=1}^\infty \, \frac{\phi_n(p)^2}{\lambda_n^s}\tag{0.4.3}
\]
It is easily seen that
$\Phi_p(s)$ is analytic in a half-space
$\mathfrak{Re} s>b$ for a large $b$.
Less trivial is the following:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{0.4.2.3 Theorem.}}
\emph{There exists an entire function
$\Psi_p(s)$ such that}
\[
\Phi_p(s)=\Psi_p(s)+\frac{1}{4\pi(s-1)}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Let us first remark that Theorem 0.4.2.3 gives Theorem 0.4.2.2 Namely,
a result  due to Wiener in the article
\emph{Tauberian theorem} [Annals of Math.1932
asserts that if $\{\lambda_n\}$ is a non-decreasing sequence of
positive numbers which tends to infinity and
$\{a_n\}$ are non-negative real numbers such that
there exists the limit
\[ 
\lim_{s\to 1}\ ,(s-1)\cdot \sum\, \frac{a_n}{\lambda_n^s}=A
\] 
then it follows that
\[
\lim_{n\to \infty}\,\lambda_n^{-1}\cdot
\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\, a_k=A
\]
\medskip

\centerline{\emph{Proof of Theorem 0.4.2.3}}

\bigskip

\noindent
Since $\mathcal G$ is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator
one easily verifies that
\[
\sum\, \lambda_n^{-2}<\infty \tag{i}
\]
This convergence entails that various constructions below are defined.
To begin with,
for each $\lambda$ outside $\{\lambda_n\}$ we set
\[
G(p,q;\lambda)=
G(p,q)+
2\pi\lambda\cdot \sum_{n=1}^\infty\,
\frac{\phi_n(p)\phi_n(q)}{\lambda_n(\lambda-\lambda_n)}\tag{ii}
\]
This gives the integral operator
$\mathcal G_\lambda$ defined on $L^2(\Omega)$ by
 \[ 
 \mathcal G_\lambda(f)(p)
 =\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \iint_\Omega\, G(p,q;\lambda )\cdot f(q)\, dq\tag{iii}
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A. Exercise.}} Use that the eigenfunctions$\{\phi_n\}$ is an orthonormal basis in
$L^2(\Omega)$ to show that
\[
(\Delta+\lambda)\cdot \mathcal G_\lambda=-E
\]
\medskip

\noindent{\bf{B. The function $F(p,\lambda)$}}.
Set
\[ 
F(p,q,\lambda)= G(p,q;\lambda)- G(p,q)
\]
Keeping $p$ fixed we see that (ii) gives
\[
\lim_{q\to p}\, F(p,q,\lambda)=
2\pi\lambda\cdot \sum_{n=1}^\infty\,
\frac{\phi_n(p)^2}{\lambda_n(\lambda-\lambda_n)}\tag{B.1}
\]
Set
\[
F(p,\lambda)=
\lim_{q\to p}\, F(p,q,\lambda)
\]
From (i) and (B.1) it follows that it is a meromorphic function in
the complex $\lambda$-plane with at most simple poles
at $\{\lambda_n\}$.
\medskip

\noindent{\bf{C. Exercise.}}
Let $0<a<\lambda_1$. Show via residue calculus that
one has the equality below in a half-space
$\mathfrak{Re}\, s>b$ provided that $b$ is 
large enough:

\[ 
\Phi(s)=
\frac{1}{4\pi^2 \cdot i}\cdot \int_{a-i\infty}^{a+i\infty}\, 
F(p,\lambda)\cdot \lambda^{-s}\, d\lambda\tag{C.1}
\]
where the line integral  is taken on the vertical  line
$\mathfrak{Re}\lambda=a$.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{D. Change of contour integrals.}}
At this stage we employ a device which goes to
Riemann and
move the integration into the half-space
$\mathfrak{Re}(\lambda)<a$.
Consider  the curve $\gamma_+$
defined as the union of the
negative real interval $(-\infty,a]$ followed by
the upper
half-circle $\{\lambda= ae^{i\theta}\,\colon 0\leq\theta\leq \pi \}$
and the 
half-line $\{\lambda= a+it\,\colon t\geq 0\}$.
Cauchy's theorem entails that 
\[ 
\int_{\gamma_+}\, F(p,\lambda)\cdot \lambda^{-s}\, d\lambda=0
\]
We leave it to the reader to contruct the
similar
curve
$\gamma_-=\bar \gamma_+$. Using 
the vanishing of these line integrals and taking the branches of the 
multi-valued function
$\lambda^s$ into the account the reader should verify the following:

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{E. Lemma.}}
\emph{One has the equality}
\[ 
\Phi(s)=\frac{a^{s-1}}{4\pi}\cdot \int_{-\pi}^\pi\,
F(ae^{i\theta})\cdot e^{(i(1-s)\theta}\,d\theta
+
\frac{\sin \pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot \int_a^\infty\, F(p,-x)\cdot x^{-s}\,dx\tag{E.1}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
The first term in the sum of the right hand side of (E.1)
is obviously an entire function of $s$. So there remains to
prove that
\[
 s\mapsto  \frac{\sin \pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot \
 \int_a^\infty\, F(p,-x)\cdot x^{-s}\,dx\tag{E.2}
\]
is meromorphic with
a single pole at $s=1$ whose residue is $\frac{1}{4\pi}$.
To attain this we  express $F(p,-x)$ when $x$ are real and positive in another way.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{F.  The $K$-function.}}
In the half-space $\mathfrak{Re}\,z>0$ there exists the analytic function
\[
K(z)= \int_1^\infty\, \frac{e^{-zt}}{\sqrt{t^2-1}}\,dt
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that $K$ extends to a multi-valued analytic function outside
$\{z=0\}$ given by
\[
K(z)=-I_0(z)\cdot \log z+ I_1(z)\tag{F.1}
\] 
where $I_0$ and $I_1$ are entire functions
with series expansions
\[
I_0(z)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty\, \frac{2^{-2m}}{(m!)^2}\cdot
z^{2m}\tag{i}
\]
\[ 
I_1(z)= \sum_{m=0}^\infty\, \rho(m)\cdot
\frac{2^{-2m}} {(m!)^2} \cdot z^{2m}\quad
\colon \rho(m)=1+\frac{1}{2}+\ldots+\frac{1}{m}-\gamma\tag{ii}
\]
where $\gamma$ is the usual Euler constant.

\bigskip


\noindent
With  $p$ kept fixed and $\kappa>0$ 
we solve the Dirichlet problem and find
a   
a function $q\mapsto H(p,q;\kappa)$ which satisfies  the
equation
\[
 \Delta(H)-\kappa\cdot H=0\tag{F.2}
\] 
in $\Omega$ with boundary values
\[ 
H(p,q;\kappa)=K(\sqrt{\kappa}|p-q|)\quad\colon q\in \partial\Omega
\]


\noindent
{\bf{G. Exercise.}}
Verify the equation
\[ 
G(p,q;-\kappa)=K(\sqrt{\kappa}\cdot |p-q|)- H(q;\kappa)\quad\colon \kappa>0
\]



\noindent
Next, recalling  the construction of $G(p,q)$
we get

\[
 F(p,-\kappa)=
 \lim_{q\to p}\,
 [K(\sqrt{\kappa}\cdot |p-q|)+\log\,|p-q|]+
 \lim_{q\to p}\,[u_p(q)+ H(p,q,\kappa)]\tag{G.1}
\]
The last term above has a "nice limit" 
$u_p(p)+H(p,p,\kappa)$ and from  (F.1)  the reder can  verify the limit formula:
\[
 \lim_{q\to p}\,
 [K(\sqrt{\kappa}\cdot |p-q|)+\log\,|p-q|]=
 -\frac{1}{2}\cdot \log \kappa +\log 2-\gamma\tag{G.2}
\]
where $\gamma$ is  Euler's constant.

\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{H. Final part of the proof.}}.
Set $A=  +\log 2-\gamma+u_p(p)$. Then (G.1) and (G.2)
give
\[
F(p,-\kappa)= -\frac{1}{2}\cdot \log \kappa +A+H(p,p;-\kappa)
\]
With $x=\kappa$ in (E.2 ) we  proceed  as follows.
To begin with the reader may verify that 
\[
s\mapsto A\cdot 
\frac{\sin \pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot \int_a^\infty\,  x^{-s}\,dx
\]
is an entire function of $s$.
Next,  consider the function
\[ 
\rho(s)=
 -\frac{1}{2}\cdot 
\frac{\sin \pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot \int_a^\infty\,  \log x\cdot x^{-s}\,dx
\]
Notice that the complex derivative
\[
\frac{d}{ds}\,  \int_a^\infty\,  x^{-s}\,dx=
- \int_a^\infty\,  \log x\cdot x^{-s}\,dx
\]

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf{H.1 Exercise.}}
Use the  above to show that
\[
\rho(s)-\frac{1}{4\pi(s-1)}
 \]
is an entire function.
\medskip


\noindent
From the above we see that Theorem 0.4.4 follows if we have proved
\medskip

\noindent
 {\bf{H.2 Lemma.}}
\emph{The following function  is entire}:
\[
s\mapsto \frac{\sin\,\pi s}{2\pi^2}\cdot
\int_a^\infty\, H(p,p,\kappa)\cdot  \kappa^{-s}\,d\kappa
\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
When $\kappa>0$
the equation (F.1) shows that $q\mapsto H(p,q;\kappa)$
is subharmonic  in $\Omega$ and the maximum principle gives
\[
0\leq  H(p,q;\kappa)\leq \max_{q\in\partial\Omega}\,K(\kappa|p-q|)\tag{i}
\]
With  $p\in\Omega$ fixed there is 
a positive number
$\delta$ such that
$|p-q|\geq\delta\,\colon q\in \partial\Omega$ which  
gives
positive constants
$B$ and  $\alpha$  such that
\[
H(p,p;\kappa)\leq e^{-\alpha\kappa}\quad\colon \kappa>0\tag{ii}
\]
The reader may now check that this
exponential decay gives Lemma H.2.

\centerline {\bf  {¤ 1. Bounded self-adjoint operators.}}

\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf Introduction.}
A bounded linear operator $S$ on a complex Hilbert space
$\mathcal H$ is 
self-adjoint if $S=S^*$ which means that
\[ 
\langle x,Sy \rangle=
\langle Sx, y\rangle\quad\colon\quad x,y\in \mathcal H\tag{*}
\]
If $S$ is self-adjoint one has  the equality of operator norms:
\[ 
||S||^2=||S^2||\tag{1}
\]
To see this we notice that if $x\in\mathcal H$ has norm one then
\[
\langle Sx,Sx\rangle=
\langle x,S^*Sx\rangle=
\langle x,S^2x\rangle\tag{2}
\]
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality the last term
is $\leq ||x|\cdot ||S^2||$ and since (2) holds for
every $x$ of unit norm  we conclude that
\[
||S||^2\leq ||S^2||
\]
Next,
the multiplicative inequality for operator norms and an
induction over $n$ give 
\[
||S||^{2n}=||S^n||^2\quad\,\colon\,\,n\geq 1
\]
Taking the $n$:th root and passing to the limit the spectral
radius formula gives
\[
||S||=\max_{|z\in\sigma(S)}\, |z|\tag{*}
\]


\noindent

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{The spectrum of a bounded self-adjoint operator
is a compact real interval.}
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Let $\lambda$ be a complex number 
and for a given $x$ we set
$y=\lambda x-Sx$.
It follows that
\[ 
||y||^2=|\lambda|^2\cdot ||x||^2+||Sx|^2+
\lambda\cdot \langle x,Sx\rangle+
\bar \lambda\cdot \langle Sx,x\rangle
\]
Since $S$ is self-adjoint
we get
\[
\lambda\cdot \langle x,Sx\rangle+
\bar \lambda\cdot \langle Sx,x\rangle=2\cdot \mathfrak{Re}(\lambda)\cdot
\langle Sx,x\rangle
\]
Now $|\langle Sx,x\rangle|\leq ||Sx||\cdot ||x||$
so the triangle inequality gives
\[
||y||^2\geq |\lambda|^2\cdot ||x||^2+||Sx|^2-2|\mathfrak{Re}(\lambda)||\cdot
||Sx||\cdot ||x||\tag{i}
\]
With $\lambda=a+ib$
the right hand side becomes
\[ 
b^2||x||^2+a^2||x||^2+||Sx||^2-2a\cdot ||Sx||\cdot ||x||\geq b^2||x||^2
\]
Hence we have proved that
\[ 
||\lambda x-Sx||^2\geq( \mathfrak{Im}\,\lambda)^2\cdot ||x||^2\tag{ii}
\]
This implies that
$\lambda E-S||$ is invertible for every non-real $\lambda$
which proves Theorem 1.1.

 Now the operational calculus from ¤ 0.6 and  Theorem 1.1   give

\noindent
{\bf{1.2 Theorem}}\emph{
 Denote by ${\bf{S}}$  the closed subalgebra of
$L(\mathcal H,\mathcal H)$ generated by $S$ and the identity
operator. Then ${\bf{S}}$ is 
isomorphic to
the sup-norm algebra
$C^0(\sigma(S))$.}



\bigskip

\centerline{\bf{1.3 Normal operators.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
A bounded linear operator $S$ is normal if it commutes with its
adjoint $S^*$.
Let $S$ be normal and put $A=S^*S$ which is
self-adjoint. From (1)  above one has
\[
||A||^2= ||A^2||=||S^2\cdot (S^*)^2||\leq
||S^2||\cdot ||(S^*)^2||\tag{1.3.1}
\]
Here $(S^*)^2$ is the adjoint of $S^2$
and   recall  that
the norms of an operator and its adjoint are equal. Hence
the right hand side in (1.3.1) is equal to $||S^2||^2$ 
and since $||A||= ||S||^2$ we get 
the equality 
\[
||S||^2= ||S^2||\tag{1.3.2}
\]
Exactly as in the self-adjoint case we can take higher powers
and obtain
the equality
\[
||S||=\max_{z\in\sigma(S)}\,|z|\tag{1.3.3}
\]
Since every polynomial in $S$ again is a normal operator
for which (1.3.3.) holds we have proved the following:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.4 Theorem}}
\emph{Let $S$ be a normal operator.
Then the closed subalgebra ${\bf{S}}$ generated by
$S$ in  $L(\mathcal H,\mathcal H)$
is a sup-norm algebra.}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
The spectrum $\sigma(S)$ is 
some compact subset of  ${\bf{C}}$ and in general analytic polynomials
restricted to $\sigma(S)$ do not generate a dense subalgebra of
$C^0(\sigma(A))$.
To get a more extensive algebra
we
consider the closed subalgebra $\mathcal B$
of
$L(\mathcal H,\mathcal H)$  generated by $S$ and $S^*$.
Since every  polynomial in $S$ and $S^*$ again is a normal operator
it follows that 
$\mathcal B$ is a sup-norm algebra and 
the following holds:

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf{1.5 Theorem.}}
\emph{The sup-norm algebra $\mathcal B$ is via the Gelfand
transform isomorphic with $C^0(\sigma(S))$.}
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
If $A\in\mathcal B$ is self-adjoint then we know from the previous section
that its
Gelfand transform is real-valued. Next, let $Q\in\mathcal B$
be arbitrary. Now $A=Q+Q^*$  is self-adjoint.
So if $p\in\mathfrak{M}_\mathcal B$
it first follows that the Gelfand transform $\widehat Q(p)+\hat Q^*(p)$ is real, i.e. 
with $\widehat Q(p)= a+ib$ we must have $\hat Q^*=a_1-ib$ for some 
real number $a_1$. Next, the product  $QQ^*$ is  also self-adjoint and hence
$(a+ib)(a_1-ib)$ is real. This gives $a=a_1$ which shows that  
the Gelfand transform of $Q^*$ is the complex conjugate function of
$\widehat Q$. Hence the Gelfand transforms of $\mathcal B$-elements is 
a self-adjoint algebra and 
the Stone-Weierstrass theorem implies that
the Gelfand transforms of $\mathcal B$-elements is 
equal to the whole algebra 
$C^0(\mathfrak{M}_\mathcal B)$.
Finally, since $\widehat S^*$ is the complex conjugate function of 
$\widehat S$, it follows that the Gelfand transform
$\widehat S$  alone separates points on $\mathfrak{M}_\mathcal B$
which means that $\mathfrak{M}_\mathcal B$
can be identified with
$\sigma(S)$.


\bigskip


\centerline {\bf{1.6 Spectral measures.}}
\medskip


\noindent
Let $S$ be a bounded normal operator
which give $\mathcal B$ and $\sigma(S)$ in Theorem 1.5. Now we 
construct  Riesz measures on
$\sigma(S)$ as follows:
Each   pair of vectors $x,y$
in
$\mathcal H$ yields
a linear functional on
$\mathcal B$ defined by 
\[ 
T\mapsto \langle Tx,y\rangle
\]
Riesz representation formula gives 
a unique Riesz measure 
$\mu_{x,y}$ on $\sigma(S)$ such that
\[
\langle Tx,y\rangle=\int_{\sigma(S)}\, \widehat T(z)\cdot d\mu_{x,y}(z)\tag{1.6.1}
\] 
hold for every $T\in \mathcal B$.
Since $\widehat S(z)=z$ we have 
\[
\langle Sx,y\rangle=\int\, z\cdot d\mu_{x,y}(z)
\]
Similarly one has
\[
\langle S^*x,y\rangle=\int\, \bar z\cdot d\mu_{x,y}(z)
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.7 The operators $E(\delta)$}}.
By (1.6.1)  the map
from $\mathcal H\times\mathcal H$ into
the space of Riesz measures on $\sigma(S)$ is bi-linear.
We have for example:
$\mu_{x_1+x_2,y}=\mu_{x_1,y}+\mu_{x_2,y}$.
Moreover, since
$\mathcal B$ is the sup-norm algebra $C^0(\sigma(S))$
the total variations of the $\mu$-measures
satisfy:
\[
||\mu_{x,y}||\leq\max_{T\in \mathcal B_*}|\langle Tx,y\rangle|\tag{1.7.1}
\]
where $\mathcal B_*$ is the unit ball in
$\mathcal B$. From this we obtain
\[
|| \mu_{x,y}||\leq ||x||\cdot ||y||\tag{1.7.2}
\]


\noindent
Next, let $\delta$ be a Borel subset of
$\sigma(S)$. Keeping $y\in \mathcal H$ fixed gives
a linear functional on $\mathcal H$ defined by
\[ 
x\mapsto 
\int_\delta \,  d\mu_{x,y}(z)=\mu_{x,y}(\delta)
\]
By (1.7.2) it has norm $\leq ||y||$ and is represented by
a vector $E(\delta)x$ in $\mathcal H$. More precisely 
\[
\langle E(\delta)x,y\rangle= 
\int_\delta \,  d\mu_{x,y}(z)=\mu_{x,y}(\delta)\tag{1.7.3}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{1.8 Exercise.}}
Show that $x\mapsto E(\delta)x$ is linear and that
the resulting linear operator
$E(\delta)$
commutes with all operators in $\mathcal B$. Moreover, show that 
it is a projection, i.e.
\[ 
E(\delta)^2=E\delta)
\]
Finally, show that
\[
E(\delta_1\cap\delta_2)=E(\delta_1)E(\delta_2)
\] 
holds for every pair of Borel subsets and with
$\delta=\sigma(S)$ one gets the identity operator.

\bigskip
\noindent
{\bf{1.9 Resolution of the identity.}}
If $\delta_1,\ldots,\delta_N$ is any finite family of disjoint 
Borel sets whose union is
$\sigma(S)$ then
\[
1= E(\delta_1)+\ldots +E(\delta_N)
\]
At the same tine we get a decomposition of the operator $S$:
\[
S=S_1+\ldots+S_N\quad\text{where}\quad
S_k=E(\delta_k)\cdot S
\]
For each $k$ the spectrum $\sigma(S_k)$ is equal to  the closure of
$\delta_k$. Hence the normal operator is represented by a sum of normal operators
where the individual operators have  small spectra when the
$\delta$-partition is fine.

\centerline{\bf{¤ 2.  Unbounded operators on Hilbert spaces}}
\bigskip


\noindent
Let $T$ be a densely and unbounded 
linear operator on $\mathcal H$.

\medskip

\noindent{\bf{2.1 The adjoint $T^*$.}}
Each vector  $y\in\mathcal H$  gives a linear functional on
$\mathcal D(T)$ defined by
\[
 x\mapsto \langle Tx,y\rangle\tag{i}
\]
If there exists a constant $C(y)$ such that
the absolute value of (i) is $\leq C(y)\cdot ||x||$ for every
$x\in\mathcal D(T)$, then  (i) extends to a continuous linear
functional on
$\mathcal H$.
The extension is unique because 
$\mathcal D(T)$ is dense and since   $\mathcal H$ 
is self-dual there is 
a
unique vector  
$T^*y$ such that
\[
\langle Tx,y\rangle=
\langle x,T^*y\rangle\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(T)
\tag{2.1.1}
\]
This gives  a linear operator $T^*$
where $\mathcal D(T^*)$ is characterised by the   above.
Next, the product $\mathcal H\times\mathcal H$
is a Hilbert space with the  inner product
\[
\langle (x,y),(x_1,y_1)\rangle= 
\langle x,x_1\rangle+\langle y,y_1\rangle
\]
On $\mathcal H\times\mathcal H$ we define the linear operator $J$ by
\[ 
J(x,y)= (-y,x)
\]


\noindent
{\bf{2.2 Proposition.}}
\emph{For every densely defined operator $T$
one has the equality}
\[ 
\Gamma(T^*)= J(\Gamma(T))^\perp
\]


\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Let $(y,T^*y)$ be a vector in
$\Gamma(T^*)$. If $x\in\mathcal D(T)$  the equality (2.1.1)
and the construction of $J$ give
\[
\langle -Tx,y\rangle + \langle  x,T^*y\rangle =0
\]
This proves  that $\Gamma(T^*)\perp
J(\Gamma(T))$. Conversely,  if 
$(y,z)\perp J(\Gamma(T))$
we have
\[
\langle -Tx,y\rangle + \langle  x,z\rangle=0
\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{i}
\]
This shows that
$y\in\mathcal D(T^*)$ and  $z=T^*y$ which proves Proposition 2.2.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.3 Consequences.}}
Since the orthogonal
complement of
a subspace in a Hilbert space is 
closed, Proposition 2.2 implies that
$T^*$ has a closed graph. Taking  the closure of
$\Gamma(T)$
the decompostion of a Hilbert space
into a direct sum of a closed subpace and its orthogonal complement gives
\[
\mathcal H\times\mathcal H=
J(\overline{\Gamma(T)})\oplus \Gamma(T^*)
\tag{2.3.1}
\]


\noindent
Notice also that 
\[
\Gamma(T^*)^\perp=J(\overline{\Gamma(T)})\tag{2.3.2}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.4 Closed extensions of operators.}}
Let $T$ be densely defined.
A closed operator $S$ 
such that
$\Gamma(T)$ is a subspace of $\Gamma(S)$ is called a
closed extension of $T$.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.4.1 Exercise.}}
Show that 
if $S$ is a  closed extension of $T$ then
\[
S^*=T^*
\]



\noindent
{\bf{2.4.2 Theorem.}}
\emph{A densely defined operator $T$  has a closed extension if and only if
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ is dense.
Moreover, if $T$ is closed one has the biduality formula
$T=T^{**}$.}
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Suppose first that $T$ has a closed extension. 
By (2.1) it suffices to show that
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ is dense when $T$ is closed. 
If $\mathcal D(T^*)$ is not dense 
there
exists a non-zero vector $0\neq h\perp \mathcal D(T^*)$ and
(2.3.2) gives
\[
(h,0)\in\Gamma(T^*)^\perp=J(\Gamma(T))\tag{ii}
\]
By the construction of $J$ this would give
$x\in\mathcal D(T)$ such that
$(h,0)=(-Tx,x)$ which cannot hold since
this equation first gives $x=$ and then
$h=T0=0$.
Hence  closedness of $T$ implies that
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ is dense.
Conversely, assume that
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ is  dense. 
Starting from $T^*$  we 
construct its adjoint  $T^{**}$ and 
(2.3.2) applied with $T^*$  gives
\[
\Gamma(T^{**})= J(\Gamma(T^*)^\perp\tag{i}
\]
At the same time 
$J(\Gamma(T^*)^\perp$ is equal to the closure of
 $\Gamma(T)$ so (i) gives
\[
\overline{\Gamma(T)}=
\Gamma(T^{**})\tag{ii}
\]
which proves that $T^{**}$ is a closed extension of $T$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.4.3 The biduality formula.}}
If $T$ from the start is closed then its graph equals that of $T^{**}$
which gives
the equality:
\[
T=T^{**}\tag{2.4.3}
\]

\medskip


\centerline {\bf{2.5 Inverse operators.}}.
\medskip

\noindent
Denote by
$\mathfrak I(\mathcal H)$ the family  of
closed and densely defined operators $T$ such that
$T$ is injective on $\mathcal D(T)$ and the range $T(\mathcal D(T))$Êis dense in
$\mathcal H$.
If $T\in\mathfrak I(\mathcal H)$
there exists the densely defined operator $S$ where
$\mathcal D(S)$ is the range of  $T$ and
\[
S(Tx)= x\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(T)
\]
Next, 
on $\mathcal H\times\mathcal H$
we have the isometry defined by
$I(x,y)= (y,x)$,  i.e we  interchange the pair of vectors.
The construction of $S$ gives 
\[ 
\Gamma(S)= I(\Gamma(T))\tag{i}
\]
Since $\Gamma(T)$ by hypothesis is closed it follows that
$S$ has a closed graph and we conclude that $S\in\mathfrak I(\mathcal H)$.
Moreover, since $I^2$ is the identity on
$\mathcal H\times \mathcal H$ we have
\[ 
\Gamma(T)= I(\Gamma(S))\tag{ii}
\]
We refer to $S$ is as the inverse of
$T$. It is denoted by $T^{-1}$
and  (ii) implies that
$T$ is the inverse of $T^{-1}$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.5.1 Exercise.}}
Let $T$ belong to
$\mathfrak I(\mathcal H)$.
Use the description of $\Gamma(T^*)$
in Proposition 2.3   to show that $T^*\in
\mathfrak I(\mathcal H)$  and the equality  
\[
(T^{-1})^*= (T^*)^{-1}\tag{*}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{2.6 The operator $T^*T$}}.
Every
$h\in\mathcal H$ gives  the vector $(h,0)$ in
$\mathcal H\times\mathcal H$ and  (2.3.1)
a  pair  $x\in\mathcal D(T)$ and $y\in\mathcal D(T^*)$.
such that
\[
(h,0)= (x,Tx)+(-T^*y,y)=(x-T^*y, Tx+y)
\]
With $u=-y$ we get $Tx=u$ and obtain
\[
 h=x+T^*(Tx)\tag{2.6.1}
\]


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.6.2  Proposition.}}
\emph{ The vector $x$ in (2.6.1) is uniquely determined by $h$.}

\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Uniqueness follows if we show that
\[
x+T^*(Tx)\implies x=0
\]
But this is clear since the construction
of $T^*$ gives
\[
0=\langle x,x)\rangle+ \langle x,T^*(Tx)\rangle=
\langle x,x)\rangle+ \langle Tx,Tx)\rangle\implies x=0
\] 
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.7 The density of $\mathcal D(T^*T)$}}.
This is a subspace of $\mathcal D(T)$ where the extra
 condition for a vector $x\in\mathcal D(T)$ is that
$Tx\in\mathcal D(T^*)$.
To prove that
$\mathcal D(T^*T)$ is dense we consider some orthogonal vector $h$.
Now (2.6.1)  gives  $x\in\mathcal D(T)$ such that
$h=x+T^*(Tx)$ and 
for every $g\in \mathcal D(T^*T)$ we have
\[
0=\langle x,g\rangle+\langle T^*Tx,g\rangle=
\langle x,g\rangle+\langle Tx,Tg\rangle=
\langle x,g\rangle+\langle x,T^*Tg\rangle
\tag{i}
\]
Here (i) hold for every $g\in\mathcal D(T^*T)$ and
by another application (2.6.1) we  can find $g_*\in\mathcal D(T^*T)$
so that
$x= g_*+T^*Tg_*$. Then (i) applied with $g_*$
gives $\langle x,x\rangle =0$. Hence $x=0$ which entials that
$h=0$  which shows that
$\mathcal D(T^*T)^\perp=0$
and the requested density follows.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.8 The equality  $TT^*=T^*T$}}.
Recall the biduality
formula in (2.4.3
and apply Proposition 2.6 starting with
$T^*$. It follows 
that
$\mathcal D(TT^*)$ also is dense and every $h\in\mathcal H$ has a unique
representation
\[ 
h= y+T(T^*y)
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2.9. Conclusion.}}
From the above $T^*T$ is densely defined.
Using the biduality formula (2.4.3) the reader may verify the equality
\[
TT^*=T^*T
\]
which means that
$T^*T$ is equal to its own adjoint.
So if $A=T^*T$ then
$A$ is closed and $A=A^*$
which entails  that $A$ is self-adjoint operator in the sense of ¤ XX  below.
Notice also that (2.6.1) entails that
the densely defined and closed operator
$E+T^*T$ is surjective, and by Proposition 2.6.2 it is injective.
Hence it has an  inverse resolvent in Neumann's sense.

\centerline{\bf{¤ 3. Symmetric operators.}}



\bigskip

\noindent
A densely defined  operator
$T$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$
is  symmetric if
\[
\langle Tx,y\rangle=
\langle x,Ty\rangle\quad\text{hold for all pairs }\quad x,y\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{*}
\]


\noindent
The symmetry means  that
the adjoint 
$T^*$   extends $T$, i.e. one has the set-theoretic inclusion
\[
\Gamma(T)\subset \Gamma(T^*)
\]
In particular $\mathcal D(T^*)$ contains the dense
space $\mathcal D(T)$ so Theorem 2.4.2 entials that
$T$ has a closed extension $\widehat{T}$ whoe graph is the
closure $\overline{\Gamma(T)}$. Moreover, since
$T^*$ has a closed graph we have the inclusion
\[
\overline{\Gamma(T)}\subset \Gamma(T^*)\tag{**}
\]
If equality holds in (**) 
the closed abnd densely operator $\widehat{T}$
is slef-adjoint, i.e. it is symmstric and equal to its adjoint.
When the inclusion  in (**)
is  strict 
one may ask if there exist
self-adjoint  operators $A$
whose graphs are  contained between
$\overline{\Gamma(T)}$ and  $\Gamma(T^*)$. To analyze this we
introduce the  eigenspaces:
\[
\mathcal D_+=\{ x\in\mathcal D(T^*)\quad\colon T^*(x)=ix\}
\quad\text{and}\quad 
\mathcal D_-=\{ x\in\mathcal D(T^*)\quad\colon T^*(x)=-ix\}
\]


\noindent
Since
$T^*$ has a closed graph  these
two subspaces of $\mathcal H$ are closed.
Next, 
$x\mapsto (x,T^*x)$ is  a bijective map between
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ and $\Gamma(T^*)$. Since
$\Gamma(T^*)$
is a closed subspace of $\mathcal H\times\mathcal H$, it follows that
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ is a Hilbert space equipped with
the inner product
\[
\{x,y\}=
\langle x,y\rangle+
\langle T^*x,T^*y\rangle
\]
Since $\widehat{T}$  has a closed graph
and $\Gamma(T)\subset \Gamma(T^*)$
it follows that
$\mathcal D(\widehat{T})$ appears as a closed subspace with vectors 
$(x,\widehat{T}x)\,\colon
x\in \mathcal D(\widehat{T})$.

\medskip


\noindent {\bf{3.1 Proposition.}}
\emph{The following  orthogonal decomposition exists in
the Hilbert space $\mathcal D(T^*)$:}
\[
\mathcal D(T^*)=\mathcal D(\widehat{T})\oplus \mathcal D_- \oplus\mathcal D_+
\tag{*}\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
The verification that the three subspaces are pairwise orthogonal is
left to the reader.
There remains to see that the direct sum is equal to
$\mathcal D(T^*)$
which amounts to show that
\[ 
\mathcal D(\widehat{T})^\perp=
\mathcal D_-\oplus \mathcal D_+\tag{1}
\]

\noindent
To verify  (1) we pick 
$y\in \mathcal D(\widehat{T})^\perp$ which gives
\[
\{x,y\}= \langle x,y\rangle+ \langle Tx,T^*y\rangle=0
\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(\widehat{T})\tag{2}
\]
Since (2) in particular hold when $x\in\mathcal D(T)$
we see that $T^*y\in\mathcal D(T^*)$ and obtain
\[
\langle x,y\rangle+ \langle x,T^*T^*y\rangle=0\quad\colon
x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{3}
\]
The density of $\mathcal D(T)$ entails that
\[ 
0=y+T^*T^*y=(T^*+iE)(T^*-iE)(y)\implies
\]
\[
\xi=T^*y-iy\in \mathcal D_-\quad\text{and}\quad
\eta=T^*y+iy\in \mathcal D_+\implies
\]
\[ 
y=\frac{1}{2i}(\eta-\xi)
\in \mathcal D_-\oplus \mathcal D_+
\]
which proves (1) above.


\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{3.2 The case when
$\dim(\mathcal D_+)= \dim(\mathcal D_-)$.}}
When they  are finite dimensional
with a common   dimension $n\geq 1$ 
self-adjoint extensions of $T$  are found as follows:
Let   $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ be an ON-basis in $\mathcal D_+$ and
$f_1,\ldots,f_n$ an ON-basis in $\mathcal D_-$.
For each $n$-tuple $e^{i\theta_1},\ldots, e^{i\theta_n}$
of complex numbers with absolute value one
we have  the subspace of $\mathcal H$
generated by $\mathcal D(T)$ and
the vectors
\[ 
\xi_k= e_k+ e^{i\theta_k}\cdot f_k\quad\colon\quad 1\leq k\leq n
\]

\medskip

\noindent
On this linear space we define a linear operator $A_\theta $ where
$A_\theta =T$ on $\mathcal D(T)$
while
\[ 
A_\theta (\xi_k)=ie_k-i e^{i\theta_k}\cdot f_k
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{3.3 Exercise.}}
Verify 
that
$A_\theta $ is self-adjoint and  prove the converse, i.e. if
$A$ is an arbitrary self-adjoint extension of $T$ with 
$\Gamma(A)\subset\Gamma(T^*)$, then $A=A_\theta$
for a unique  $n$-tuple of complex unit vectors.
Thus, the family  of self-adjoint extensions of $T$ can be identified with points on the 
$n$-dimensional torus.

\bigskip





\centerline {\bf{3.4  Example.}}
\medskip

\noindent
The following example goes back to Weyl's  studies
about self-adjoint extensions of symmetric ODE-equations
from  1910.
Let $\mathcal H$ be the Hilbert space
$L^2[0,1]$ of  square-integrable functions 
on the unit interval $[0,1]$ with  the coordinate $t$.
A dense subspace $\mathcal H_*$ consists of  functions
$f(t)\in C^1[0,1]$
such that $f(0)=f(1)=0$.  On $\mathcal H_*$
we define the operator 
$T$ by
\[ 
T(f)=if'(t)
\]
A partial integration gives
\[ 
\langle T (f),g\rangle=
 i\int_0^1\, f'(t)\cdot\bar g(t)\cdot dt=\int_0^1\, \bar g'(t)\cdot f(t)dt=
 \langle f,T(g)\rangle
\] 
Hence $T$ is symmetric.
Next, an $L^2$-function $h$  belongs to $\mathcal D(T^*)$ if and only if there exists a constant $C(h)$ such that
\[
\bigl|\int_0^1\, if'(t)\cdot\bar h(t)dt\bigr|\leq
C(h)\cdot ||f||_2\quad\colon f\in \mathcal H_*
\] 
This means that
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ consists of all $L^2$-functions $h$ such that
the distribution derivative $\frac{dh}{dt}$ again belongs to $L^2$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that 
\[ 
\mathcal D_+=\{h\in L^2\quad\colon\frac{dh}{dt}=ih\}
\] 
is a 1-dimensional vector space
generated by the $L^2$-function $e^{ix}$.
Similarly, $\mathcal D_-$ is 1-dimensional and generated
by $e^{-ix}$.
\medskip

\noindent
\emph {Self-adjoint extensions of $T$}.
For each  complex number
$e^{i\theta}$  we get the linear  space  
$\mathcal D_\theta$
of functions
$f(t)\in\mathcal D(T^*)$ such that
\[ 
f(1)= e^{i\theta}f(0)
\]


\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Verify
that one gets a  self-adjoint operator $T_\theta$
which extends $T$ where 
is   $\mathcal D(T_\theta)= \mathcal D_\theta$.
Conversely, show every  self-adjoint extension of
$T$ is equal to $T_\theta$
for some
$\theta$. Hence the family $\{T_\theta\}$
give all self-adjoint extensions of $T$.


\bigskip

 
\centerline {\bf{3.5 Semi-bounded symmetric operators.}}
\bigskip

\noindent 
Let $T$ be  closed, densely defined and symmetric.
It is said to be bounded
below 
if there exists some positive constant $k$ such that
\[ 
\langle Tx,x\rangle \geq k\cdot ||x||\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{*}
\]

\medskip


\noindent
An example is when $K(x,y)$ is a symmetric positive kernel function
on $[0,1]^2$ which gives a densely defined operator on
$L^2[0,1]$. 
That the associated symmetric integral operator
is self-adjoint
was proved in [Carleman].
Passing to the "abstract case" where one starts from 
some $T$ for which (*) holds, its 
self-adjoint extension was  later described
by
Friedrichs and von Neumann in a general set-up which goes as follows:
A sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $\mathcal D(T)$ is called a strong
Cauchy-sequence if 
\[
\lim_{m,n\to \infty}\,
||x_n-x_m||^2+|| T(x_n-x_m)||^2=0
\]
Denote by $\mathcal D_0$ the linear space of vectors $y$ for which
there exist a strong Cauchy sequence $\{x_n\}$  with 
$y=\lim x_n$. Put
\[
\mathcal D_*=\mathcal D_0\,\cap\,  \mathcal D(T^*)
\]
\medskip

\noindent{\bf{3.5.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{The restriction of the adjoint $T^*$ to $\mathcal D_*$ yields a self-adjoint operator.
Moreover the range of this self-adjoint operator is equal to $\mathcal H$.}
 
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof}
We can assume that $k=1$Êin (*)  and 
on $\mathcal D(T)$ we have the Hermitian bilinear form:
\[
\{x,y\}= \langle Tx,y\rangle \quad\text{where (*) entails that}\quad 
\{x,x\}\geq ||x||^2\tag{i}
\]
This Hermitian form extends uniquely $\mathcal D_0$ 
where it becomes complete so that
$\mathcal D_0$ is a Hilbert space. Next, one has the equality
\[ 
T^*(\mathcal D_0)=\mathcal H\tag{ii}
\]
To see this we take an arbitrary vector $x\in\mathcal H$ which gives
a continuous linear functional on $\mathcal D_0$ 
defined by
\[ 
y\mapsto \langle y,x\rangle
\]
Since $\mathcal H$
is self-dual we find a  vector
$z\in\mathcal D_0$ such that
\[
\langle y,x\rangle=\{y,z\}=\langle Ty,z\rangle\tag{iii}
\]
This holds in particular for every
$y\in\mathcal D(T)$ and hence 
$z$ belongs to $\mathcal D(T^*)$ so that  (iii) gives
\[
\langle y,x\rangle=\langle y,T^*(z)\rangle\tag{iv}
\]
The density of $\mathcal D_0$ in $\mathcal H$
therefore gives
$x=T^*(z)$ and (ii) is proved.
Finally, denote by  $T_1$  the linear operator with 
$\mathcal D(T_1)= \mathcal D_0$ and $T_1(x)= T^*(x)$. It is easily seen that
$T_1$ is closed and  symmetric. Now
the requested self-adjointness follows  from (ii) and 
the result below.

\medskip

\noindent{\bf{3.5.2 Proposition}}.
\emph{Let $S$
be a  densely defined, closed and symmetric operator such that}
\[
S(\mathcal D(S))=\mathcal H\tag{*}
\]
\emph{Then $S$ is self-adjoint.}
\medskip



\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Let $S^*$ be the adjoint of $S$.
When 
$y\in\mathcal D(S^*)$ we have by definition
\[
\langle Sx,y\rangle =\langle x,S^*y\rangle\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(S)
\]
If $S^*y=0$ this entails that
$\langle Sx,y\rangle=0$ for all $x\in\mathcal D(S)$ so 
the assumption that
$S(\mathcal D(S))=\mathcal H$ 
gives $y=0$ and hence  $S^*$ is injective.
Finally, if $x\in\mathcal D(S^*)$
the hypothesis (*) gives $\xi\in\mathcal D(S)$ such that
\[
S(\xi) =S^*(x)\tag{i}
\] 
Since $S$ is symmetric,
$S^*$ extends $S$ so that 
(i) gives  $S^*(x-\xi)=0$. Since we already proved that
$S^*$ is injective  we have
$x=\xi$. This proves that 
$\mathcal D(S)=\mathcal D(S^*)$ which means that   $S$ is self-adjoint.

\centerline{\bf{3.6 Factorizations of non-symmetric kernels.}}


\bigskip

\noindent
In Carleman's thesis [ xxx 1916 ] 
spectral properties of  
Neumann-Poincar kernels are  reduced to  the symmetric case.
Recall that
the Neumann-Poincar kernel $K(p,q)$ of  a
plane $C^1$-curve $\mathcal C$
is given by
\[ 
K(p,q)= \frac{|\langle p-q,{\bf{n}}_i(p)\rangle|}{|p-q|}
\]
where $\bf{n}_i(p)$ denote inner normal vectors.
Let $R$ be a positive number which exceeds the diameter of 
$\mathcal C$
so that
$|p-q|<R\,\colon\, p,q\in\mathcal C$.
Set
\[
N(p,q)= \int_\mathcal C\, 
K(p,\xi )\cdot \log\,\frac{R}{|q-\xi|}\cdot ds(\xi)
\]



\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}} Verify that
$N$ is symmetric, i.e. $N(p,q)= N(q,p)$
hold for all pairs $p,q$ in $\mathcal C$.
Moreover, 
\[ 
S(p,q)=\log\, \frac{R}{|p-q|}
\] 
is a symmetric and positive kernel function
and since $\mathcal C$ is of class $C^1$ the reader should verify that it gives a
Hilbert-Schmidt kernel, i.e.
\[ 
\iint_{\mathcal C\times\mathcal C}\,
S(p,q)^2\, ds(p)ds(q)<\infty
\]



\noindent
Hence the
Neumann-Poincar kernel $\mathcal K$ appears in an
equation
\[ 
\mathcal N= \mathcal K\circ \mathcal S\tag{*}
\] 
where $\mathcal S$ is defined via a positive  symmetric Hilbert-Schmidt kernel.
Following  
[Carleman: ¤ 11 ] we describe   
the spectrum of $\mathcal K$.


\medskip

\noindent {\bf{3.6.1  Spectral properties of  non-symmetric kernels.}}
In general, let  $K(x,y)$ be a continuous real-valued function on the closed unit square
$\square=\{0\leq x,y\leq 1\}$ and 
assume that there exists a positive definite
Hilbert-Schmidt kernel $S(x,y)$ such that
\[ 
N(x,y)=\int_0^1\, S(x,t) K(t,y)\, dy
\] 
yields a symmetric kernel function.
The Hilbert-Schmidt theory
gives
an orthonormal basis $\{\phi_n\}$ in
$L^2[0,1]$ formed by eigenfunctions to $\mathcal S$ where
\[ 
\mathcal S\phi_n=\kappa_n \phi_n\tag{1}
\] 
where the positive $\kappa$-numbers  tend to zero and
each $u\in L^2[0,1]$
has a Fourier-Hilbert  expansion
\[ 
 u= \sum\,\alpha_n\cdot \phi_n\tag{2}
\]
We  seek 
eigenfunctions of  the integral operator $\mathcal K$.
Let  $u$ be  a function in $L^2[0,1]$
such that:
\[ 
u=\lambda\cdot \mathcal Ku\tag{3}
\]
where
$\lambda$ in general is a complex number. It follows that
\[
\lambda\cdot \int\, N(x,y)u(y)\, dy
=
\lambda\iint SA(x,t)K(t,y)u(y)\, dtdy=
\int S(x,t)u(t)\,dt\tag{4}
\]
Multiplying  with $\phi_p(x)$ an integration gives
\[
\lambda\cdot \int\, \phi_p(x)N(x,y)u(y)\, dx dy=
\iint \phi_p(x) S(x,t)u(t)\,dxdt=
\kappa_p\int \phi_p(t)u(t) \, dt\tag{5}
\]
Next,   the expansion of $u$ from (2) gives
the equations:
\[
\sum_{q=1}^\infty \alpha_q\cdot 
\iint  \phi_q(x)\phi_p(x)N(x,y)\, dx dy=\kappa_p\alpha_p
\quad\colon\, p=1,2,\ldots\tag{6}
\]
Set
\[
c_{qp}=\iint  \phi_q(x)\phi_p(x)N(x,y)\, dx dy
\]
It follows that $\{\alpha_p\}$ satisfies the system
\[
\kappa_p\alpha_p=
\lambda\cdot \sum_{q=1}^\infty \, c_{qp}\alpha_q\tag{7}
\]
Since $N(x,y)= N(y,x)$ the
doubly indexed $c$-sequence is symmetric. Set
\[ 
\beta_p= \sqrt{\kappa_p}\cdot \alpha_p
\implies
\beta_p=\lambda\cdot \sum_{q=1}^\infty
\frac{c_{pq}}{\sqrt{\kappa_p}\cdot \sqrt{\kappa_q}}
\cdot \beta_q\tag{8}
\]



\noindent
Next, 
put
\[
k_{p,q}=\iint K(x,y)\phi_p(x)\phi_q(y)\, dxdy\tag{9}
\]
From  the above  the following hold for each pair $p,q$:

\[ c_{pq}= \iiint\,
\phi_q(x)\phi_p(y) S(x,t)K(t,y)\, dxdydt=
\kappa_qk_{p,q}=\kappa_pk_{q,p}\implies
\]
\[ 
\frac{c_{p,q}^2}{ \kappa_p\cdot \kappa_q}\leq
|k_{p,q}\cdot  k_{q,p}|
\leq \frac{1}{2}(k_{p,q}^2+k_{q,p}^2)\tag{10}
\]
Here $\{k_{p,q}\}$ are the Fourier-Hilbert coefficients of $K(x,y)$
which entails that
\[ 
\sum\sum\, k_{p,q}^2\leq
\iint K(x,y)^2\, dxdy
\]
Hence the symmetric and doubly indexed sequence
\[
\frac{c_{p,q}}{\sqrt{\kappa_p\cdot \kappa_q}}\tag{11}
\] 
is of Hilbert-Schmidt type.
\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{3.6.2 Conclusion.}}
The eigenfunctions $u$ in $L^2[0,1]$
associated to the $\mathcal K$-kernel have Fourier-Hilbert expansions via
the $\{\phi_n\}$-basis  which are  determined by 
$\alpha$-sequences  satisfying the system (7)


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{3.6.3 Remark.}}
When a plane curve
$\mathcal C$ has corner points the
Neumann-Poincar kernel is
unbounded. Here
the reduction to the symmetric case is  more involved  and leads 
to
quite intricate results which appear in Part II from
Carleman's Ph.d-thesis.
The interplay  between singularities
on boundaries in 
the Neumann-Poincar equation
and  corresponding unbounded kernel functions 
illustrates  the 
general theory
densely defined self-adjoint operators.
Much analysis remains to be done and
open problems about
the Neumann-Poincar equation 
remain to be settled in dimension three. So far  it appears that
only the 2-dimensional case 
is properly understood via 
results  in [Carleman:1916].

\centerline{\bf{¤ 4.  Unbounded self-adjoint operators.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
A densely defined operator $A$ 
on the Hilbert space $\mathcal H$
for which $A=A^*$ is called self-adjoint. 


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{4.1 Proposition}}
\emph{The spectrum of a self-adjoint operator
$A$ is contained in
the real line. Moreover, if
$\lambda$ is non-real  the resolvent
satisfies the norm inequality}
\[ 
||R_\lambda||\leq \frac{1}{|\mathfrak{Im}\,\lambda|}
\]


\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Set $\lambda=a+ib$ where $b\neq 0$.
If $x\in\mathcal D(A)$ and $y=\lambda x-Ax$ we have
\[
||y||^2=|\lambda|^2\cdot ||x||^2+||Ax||^2-2\cdot \mathfrak{Re}(\lambda)\cdot \langle x,Ax\rangle
\]

\noindent
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives
\[
||y||^2\geq b^2||x||^2+ a^2||x||^2+||Ax||^2-2|a|\cdot ||Ax||\cdot ||x||
\geq
b^2||x||^2\tag{i}
\]

\noindent
This proves that  $x\to \lambda x-Ax$ is injective and
since
$A$ is closed  the range of
$\lambda\cdot E-A$ is closed.
Next, if $y$ is $\perp$ to this range we have
\[
0=\lambda \langle x,y\rangle -\langle Ax,y\rangle\quad\colon
x\in\mathcal D(A)
\]
From this we see that $y$ belongs to $\mathcal D(A^*)$ and since
$A$ is self-adjoint we get
\[
0=\lambda \langle x,y\rangle -\langle x,Ay\rangle
\]
This holds for all $x$ in the dense subspace $\mathcal D(A)$ which gives
$\lambda\cdot y=Ay$
Since $\lambda$ is non-real we have already seen that this entails that
$y=0$.
Hence the range of $\lambda\cdot E-A$ is equal to $\mathcal H$ and the inequality
(i) entails $R_A(\lambda)$
has norm
$\leq\frac{1}{|\mathfrak{Im}\lambda}|$.


\medskip

\noindent{\bf{4.2 An adjoint formula.}}
Let $A$ be self-adjoint.
If  $\lambda$ is non-real
we have the adjoint formula:
\[
\bar\lambda-A= (\lambda\cdot E-A)^*
\]
So when we take the complex conjugate of $\lambda$ it follows that
¤ 9.5 that 
\[
R_A(\lambda)^*= R_A(\bar\lambda)
\]

\noindent


\medskip

\noindent{\bf{4.3 Properties of resolvents.}}
Let $A$ be self-adjoint.
By Neumann's resolvent calculus 
the family $\{(R_\lambda\}$ 
consists of pairwise commuting bounded operators
outside the spectrum of $A$.
In particular
there exist that operator-valued analytic functions $\lambda\mapsto R_\lambda$Ê
in the upper- respectively the lower half-plane.
Moreover, since the resolvent operators commute, it follows
from (9.12) that
$R_A(\lambda)$ commutes with its adjoint, i.e.
every resolvent is a normal operator.


\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{4.4  A special resolvent operator.}}
Take $\lambda=i$ and set
$R=R_A(i)$. So here
\[ 
R(iE-A)(x)= x\quad\colon\quad x\in\mathcal D(A)
\]

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{4.5  Theorem.}}
\emph{The spectrum $\sigma(R)$ is contained in the circle}
\[
C_*=\{|\lambda+i/2|= 1/2\}
\]


\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Since $\sigma(A)$ is confined to the real line, it follows from
¤ 0.0.5.1 that
points in $\sigma(R)$ have the form
\[
\lambda=\frac{1}{i-a}\quad\colon a\in {\bf{R}}
\]
This gives
\[
\lambda+i/2=\frac{1}{i-a}+i/2=
\frac{1}{2(i-a)}(2+i^2-ia)=
\frac{1-ia}{2i(1+ia)}
\]
and the last term has absolute value $1/2$ for every real $a$.




\bigskip



\centerline{\bf{¤ 5.  The spectral theorem for unbounded 
self-adjoint operators.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
 The operational calculus  applies to the bounded
normal operator $R$ from (4.4).
If $N$ is a positive integer we
set
\[
C_*(N)=\{\lambda\in C_*\,\colon\,\mathfrak {Im}(\lambda)
\leq - \frac{1}{N}\}\quad\text{and}\quad 
\Gamma_N=D_*(N)\cap \sigma(R)
\]
Here
$\Gamma_N$
is a 
a compact subset of $\sigma(R)$. The function 
$g(\lambda)= \frac{1-i\lambda}{\lambda}$
is analytic  in a neighborhood of $\Gamma_N$ and 
operational calculus gives the bounded
linear operator
\[ 
S_N=g(R)
\]
On $\Gamma_N$ we have
 $\lambda=-i/2+\zeta$ where
$|\zeta|= 1/2$ which gives
\[
\frac{1-i\lambda}{\lambda}=
\frac{1/2-i\zeta}{-i/2+\zeta}
=\frac{(1/2-i\zeta)(i/2+\bar\zeta)}{|\zeta-i/2|^2}
=\frac{\mathfrak{Re}\,\zeta}{|\zeta-i/2|^2}\tag{1}
\]
Neumann's the spectral equation implies 
that
$\sigma(S_N)$ is real. Since the operator $S_N$ also is normal it follows from ¤ xx
that it is self-adjoint.
Moreover, we notice that
\[ 
\lambda\cdot (\frac{1-i\lambda}{\lambda}+i)=1
\]
Hence
operational calculus  gives the operator equation
\[
R(S_N+i)=E(\Gamma_N)\tag{i}
\]
Notice also that
\[
R\cdot S_N=(E-iR)\cdot E(\Gamma_N)\tag{ii}
\]
Hence (i-ii) entail that
\[
E(\Gamma_N)-iRE(\Gamma_N)=(E-iR)\cdot E(\Gamma_N)\tag{iii}
\]


\medskip

\noindent
Next, the equation $RA=E-iR$ gives
\[
RAE(\Gamma_N)=(E-iR)E(\Gamma_N)=R\dot S_N\tag{*}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{5.1 Exercise.}}
Conclude from the above that
\[
AE(\Gamma_N)= SE(\Gamma_N)\tag{*}
\] 
where  the right hand side is a bounded self-adjoint operator.
Show also that:
\[ 
\lim_{N\to\infty}\, AP_N(x)= A(x)\quad
\text{for each}\quad x\in\mathcal D(A)\tag{**}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{5.2 Conclusion.}}
Together (*) and (**) give the spectral resolution of $A$.
Moreover, for each bounded
Borel set $e$
 on the real line
we get a corresponding Borel set on
$e_*$ in $\sigma(R)$ as desribed in (XX) above.
The operational calculus gives the bounded
self-adjoint projection $P_{e_*}$ and 
the spectrum of the bounded self-adjoint
operator
$AP_{e_*}$ is confined to the closure of
$e$.
More generally,  real-valued and bounded Borel function 
$g(t)$ on the real line with compact support there exists
the bounded
self-adjoint operator
$g(A)$ which commutes with $A$.

\centerline {{\bf 5.3 The case of integral operators.}}
\bigskip


\noindent 
Restricting
the attention to self-adjoint operators on separable Hilbert spaces
we  can present the spectral theorem
in a  transparent way since 
the  spectral Riesz measures arise 
via limits of measures obtained
from Hilbert's result for bounded
self-adjoint operators. Let us first insert:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A historic  comment.}}
In a 
plenary talk [Carleman]
at the Scandinavian
Congress held at Copenhagen in 1925, Carleman 
described the relation to
the new spectral theory with Fredholm's
pioneering discoveries
where Carleman
expressed his admiration for his  work:

\medskip



\centerline {\bf{5.3.1  An ugly example.}}
\medskip


\noindent
Following Carleman
in [ibid] we
give  an example which
illustrates that
new phenomena can occur for unbounded symmetric operators.
On the unit interval $[0,1]$ we get an orthonormal family of
functions $\psi_0,\psi_1,\ldots$ where
$\psi_0=1$ is the identity and
$\psi_1(x)= -1$ on $(0,1/2)$Êand +1 on $(1/2,1)$. For each 
$n\geq 2$ we set:
\[
\psi_n(x)=-2^{\frac{n-1}[{2}} \,\colon\,
1-2^{-n+1}\leq x< 1-2^{-n}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\psi_n(x)=2^{\frac{n-1}{2}}\,\colon\, 1-2^{-n}<x<1
\]
while $\psi_n(x)=$ when $0<x< 1-2^{-n+1}$.
If $\{a_p\}$ is a sequence of real numbers we define
the kernel
function  on $[0,1)\times [0,1)$
by
\[
K(x,y)=\sum\, a_p\cdot \psi_p(x)\psi_q(x)\tag{i}
\]
It is clear that $K$
is symmetric and the associated operator 
\[
\mathcal K(u)(x)=\int_0^1\, K(x,y)u(y)\, dy
\]
is  defined on $L^2$-functions $u$ supported by
$0\leq x\leq x_*$ for every  $x_*<1$ and therefore  densely defined.
Choose a sequence $\{a_p\}$ such that
the positive series.
\[
\sum_{p=0}^\infty \, \frac{2^p}{1+a_p^2}<\infty\tag{ii}
\]
This convergence  means that
the sequence $\{a_p\}$ must have a high rate of growth so
the kernel function (i) becomes  turbulent when
$x$ and $y$ approach 1.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that (ii) entails that there exists an $L^2$-function
$\phi(x)$ such that $\mathcal K(\phi)$ also is an $L^2$-function and
\[
\phi= i\cdot \mathcal K(\phi)
\]
If necessary, consult [ibid: page 62-66] for a demonstration. 



\bigskip


\centerline {\bf{5.3.2 A favourable case.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
The example above
shows that 
new phenomena can occur if one
starts
with a symmetric linear operator $A$
on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ which only is  densely defined.
Let us now
expose Carleman's results for "wellbehaved"
integral operators.
Let $K(x,y)$ be a complex-valued function defined in
the open unit square $\{0 <x,y<1\}$
satisfying the hermitian condition
\[ 
K(y,x)= \bar K(x,y)
\]
Assume  that for all $x$ outside a nullset $\mathcal N$
one has a finite integral
\[ 
\int_0^1\, |K(x,y)|^2\, dy\tag{1}
\]
However,  the almost everywhere defined values in (1)
need not give an integrable function. i.e. it can occur that
the double integral
\[
\iint_\square\, |K(x,y)|^2\, dxdy=+\infty\tag{2}
\]
But even when (2) occurs
we notice that
if $\phi(y)$ is an $L^2$-function, 
the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality gives:
\[
\int_0^1\, K(x,y)\phi(y)\, dy\quad\text{exists for all} 
\quad x\in (0,1)\setminus \mathcal N
\]


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.1  Definition.}} \emph{The hermitian kernel $K$ is of type
I if
the homogeneous equation}
\[
\phi(x)=\lambda\cdot \int_0^1\, K(x,y)\phi(y)\, dy
\]
\emph{has no non-trivial solution $\phi$ when
$\mathfrak{Im}\,\lambda\neq 0$.}
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.2  Theorem.}}
\emph{If $K$ is of type I then the equation
below has  a unique $L^2$-solution $\phi$ for every
$f\in L^2$ for  every non-real $\lambda$:}
\[
\phi(x)=\lambda\cdot \int_0^1\, K(x,y)\phi(y)\, dy+f(x)\tag{*}
\]
\emph{Moreover one has the estimate}
\[
\int_0^1\, |\phi(x)|^2\,dx\leq \frac{|\lambda|^2}{\mathfrak{Im}(\lambda)^2}
\cdot  \int_0^1\, |f(x)|^2\,dx\tag{**}
\]
\medskip

\noindent {\emph{Proof}}.
To prove this
 we use the truncated kernels
$\{K_n(x,y)\}$
where $K_n(x,y)=K(x,y)$ when
$K(x,y)|\leq n$ and otherwise zero.
Given  $f(x)\in L^2[0,1]$ and a non-real
$\lambda$, the Hilbert-Schmidt theory from ¤ xx gives
a unique $\phi_n\in L^2$ such that
\[
\phi_n(x)=\lambda\cdot \int_0^1\, K_n(x,y)\phi_n(y)\, dy+f(x)\tag{i}
\]
Mutltiplying with $\bar\phi_n$ it follows that
\[
\frac{1}{\lambda}\, 
 \int_0^1\, \bar\phi_n(x)(\phi_n(x)-f(x))\, dx=
 \iint_\square \, K_n(x,y)\bar\phi_n(x)\phi_n(y)\, dxdy
\] 
Since $K_n$ is hermitian the right hand side is real  and taking imaginary
parts we obtain

\[
\bigl(\frac{1}{\lambda}-\frac{1}{\bar\lambda}\bigr)\cdot
 \int_0^1\, |\phi_n(x|^2\,dx)=
\frac{1}{\lambda}\cdot
 \int_0^1\, \bar \phi_n(x)f(x) dx)
 -\frac{1}{\bar \lambda}\cdot
 \int_0^1\, \phi_n(x)\bar f(x) dx)\tag{ii}
\] 
and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality 
gives
\[
 \int_0^1\, |\phi_n(x)|^2\,dx\leq \frac{|\lambda|^2}{\mathfrak{Im}(\lambda)^2}
 \cdot  \int_0^1\, |f(x)|^2\,dx\tag{iii}
\]
Hence the $L^2$-norms of $\{\phi_n\}$ are uniformly bounded
and we can
find a subsequence which converges weakly to an
$L^2$-function $\phi$ whose $L^2$-norm again is bounded
by the right
hand side in (iii). We leave it to the reader to check that
$\phi$ solves the equation (*) and since
$K$ is of type I the limit $\phi$ is unique which'entails that the
whole sequence $\{\phi_n\}$ converges weakly to $\phi$
which is the 
requested solution  to the
inhomogenous equation (*).


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.3 Spectral measures.}}
Let $K(x,y)$ be a hermitian kernel of type I.
Hilbert's theorem applies to the bounded
kernels $\{K_n\}$
and give for each pair $f,g\in L^2[0,1]$
a Riesz measure
$\mu^n_{f,g}$ supported by the compact real spectrum of
the kernel operator defined by $K_n$.
A "non-trivial analysis" in
Carleman's monograph  [ibid] shows 
that
the sequence
$\{\mu_{f,g}^n\}$ converges weakly to a
Riesz-measure $\mu_{f,g}$ supported by the real line. Now
Hilbert's operational calculus applies when
one integrates continuous functions
$\phi(t)$ with compact support, i.e. every
such $\phi$ yields a bounded
linear operator
$\Phi$ on $L^2[0,1]$ such that
\[
\int_0^1\, \Phi(f)\cdot \bar g\, dx=
\int\, \phi(t)d\mu_{f,g}(t)
\]
hold for every pair $f,g$Êin $L^2[0,1]$
and from this one can read off the conclusions in ¤ 5.2


\bigskip

\centerline{\bf{¤ 6. Proof of Theorem xx.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
Recall that we study the operator
$L\Delta+c$ which is densely defined on
$L^2({\bf{R}}^3)$. Set
\[ 
A(p,q)=\frac{1}{|p-q|}+\frac{|p-q|}{R^2}-\frac{2}{R}
\]
If $D$ is an open domain in
${\bf{R}}^3$
and $\phi\in L^2(D)$, then Newton's classical formula
shows that a function $u$ satisfies the inhomogeneous equation
$\Delta(u)=\phi$ if and only if the following hold for
every open ball of radius $R$
\[ 
u(p)=
\frac{1}{2\pi R^2}\cdot
\iiint_{B_R}\, \frac{\phi(q)}{|p-q|}\, dq+
\frac{1}{4\pi }\cdot
\iiint_{B_R}\, A(p,q)\cdot \phi(q)\, dq
\]
From this Greens formula gives the equation below for bounded domains $D$ with

\noindent
Using (6.1)  a  straighforward investigation  of solutions to
$L$-equations over relatively compact balls
which is left as an exercise to the reader,
gives a sufficient 
condition in order that
the symmetric operator $L$ which to begin with
is defined on test-functions in
${\bf{R}}^3$, has a self-adjoint extension 
whose the domain of definition precisely consists of those
$u\in L^2 {\bf{R}}^3$ for which
$L(u)$ stays square integrable. More precisely, a sufficient 
condition is that   the following
hold 
for each pair $u,v$ in $\mathcal D(L)$:
\[
\liminf_{R\to \infty}\,
\int_{S_R}\, \,\bigl |\, u\cdot \frac{\partial v}{\partial {\bf{n}}}
-v\cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial {\bf{n}}}\,\bigr|\, d\sigma_R=0\tag{*}
\] 
where $S_R$  denote spheres of radius $R$ and $\sigma_R$ is the  area measure.
There remains to show that
the existence of a constant $M$ such that
\[ 
\limsup_{x^2+y^2+z^2}\, c(x,y,z)\leq M\tag{**}
\]
gives (*).
To prove this implication 
one needs  the following:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Lemma.}} \emph{For each  $u\in\mathcal D(L)$ one has}
\[
\liminf_{R\to \infty}\,
\int_{S_R}\, \frac{\partial u}{\partial {\bf{n}}}\, d\sigma_R=0\tag{6.2}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
The proof is left as an exercise.
If necessary, consult [p. 178 in Carleman] for details.
\medskip

\noindent
Next, apply (6.1) with $v=u$. Then (6.2)
and (**) entail
that the Dirichlet integral
\[
\iiint\,  |\nabla(u)|^2\, dq<\infty\tag{6.3}
\]
and \emph {a fortiori}
\[
\int_0^\infty\, \bigl[
\int_{S_R}\, (\frac{\partial u}{\partial {\bf{n}}})^2\, d\sigma_R\,\bigr]\, dR\tag{6.4}
<\infty
\]
The same holds for $v$  which 
entails that 
\[
\int_0^\infty\, \bigl[
\int_{S_R}\,(u^2+v^2+
 (\frac{\partial u}{\partial {\bf{n}}})^2+ (\frac{\partial v}{\partial {\bf{n}}})^2)\,
 d\sigma_R\,\bigr]\, dR<\infty\tag{6.5}
 \]
 Set 
 \[ 
 J(R)=\int_{S_R}\, \,\bigl|u\cdot \frac{\partial v}{\partial {\bf{n}}}
-v\cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial {\bf{n}}}\,\bigr|\, d\sigma_R\tag{6.6}
\]
Now (6.5 ) and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality give
\[ 
\int_0^\infty\, J(R)\, dR<\infty\tag{6.6}
\]
Finally it is clear that (6.6) gives
(*) above.

\centerline{\bf{Appendix. Linear operators and spectral theory.}}

\bigskip



\noindent
Let $X$ be a Banach space and
$T\colon X\to X$
a linear and densely defined operator whose 
domain of definition 
is  denoted by $\mathcal D(T)$.
In general $T$ is unbounded:
\[
\max_{x\in \mathcal D_*(T)}\, ||T(x)||=+\infty
\]
where the maximum is taken over
unit vectors in
$\mathcal D(T)$.




\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.1 Inverse operators.}}
A densely defined operator $T$ has a bounded inverse
if the range $T(\mathcal D(T))$ is equal to $X$
and there
exists a positive constant $c$ such that
\[
||T(x)||\geq c\cdot ||x||\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{i}
\]
Since
$T(\mathcal D(T))=X$, (i) gives
for each
$x\in X$ a unique vector $R(x)\in\mathcal D(T)$
such that
\[
T\circ R(x)= x\tag{ii}
\]
Moreover, the inequality (i) gives
\[
||R(x)||\leq c^{-1}\cdot ||x||\quad\colon x\in X\tag{iii}
\]
and when  $R$ is applied to the left on both sides in (ii), it follows that
\[ 
R\circ T(x)=x\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{iv}
\]


\noindent{\bf{A.2 The spectrum $\sigma(T)$}}.
Let
$E$ be the identity operator on $X$. Each complex number
$\lambda$ gives  the densely defined
operator $\lambda\cdot E-T$.
If it fails to be invertible one   says that
$\lambda$ is a spectral  point of $T$ and denote this set
by
$\sigma(T)$.
If $\lambda\in{\bf{C}}\setminus \sigma(T)$
the  inverse  to
$\lambda\cdot E-T$ is denoted by $R_T(\lambda)$
and called a Neumann resolvent to $T$.
By the construction in (A.1)
the range of every Neumann resolvent 
is equal to $\mathcal D(T)$
and one has the  equation:
\[
T\circ R_T(\lambda)(x)= 
R_T(\lambda)\circ T (x)\quad\colon x\in \mathcal D(T)\tag{A.2.1}
\]




\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Example.}}
Let $X$ be the Hilbert space $\ell^2$ whose vectors are  complex sequences
$\{c_1,c_2,\ldots\}$ for which $\sum\ |c_n|^2<\infty$.
We have  the dense subspace $\ell^2_*$ vectors such that
$c_n\neq 0$ only occurs for finitely many integers $n$.
If $\{\xi_n\}$ is an arbitrary sequence of complex numbers
there exists the densely defined operator $T$ on $\ell^2$
which
sends every sequence  vector $\{c_n\}\in \ell_*^2$ to
the vector $\{\xi_n\cdot c_n\}$.
If $\lambda$ is a complex number 
the reader may check that
(i) holds in (A.1) if and only if
there exists a  constant $C$ such that
\[
|\lambda-\xi_n|\geq C\quad\colon n=1,2,\ldots\tag{i}
\]
Thus, $\lambda\cdot E-T$ has a bounded  inverse if and ony if
$\lambda$ belongs to the open complement of the closure of the
set
$\{\xi_n\}$ taken in the complex plane.
Moreover,   if (i) holds then
$R_T(\lambda)$ is the bounded
linear operator on $\ell^2$
which sends $\{c_n\}$ to 
$\{\frac{1}{\lambda-\xi_n}\cdot c_n\}$.
Since
every closed subset of ${\bf{C}}$
is equal to the closure of a denumerable set of points our
construction  shows that the spectrum of a 
densely defined
operator $\sigma(T)$ can be an arbitrary closed set in
${\bf{C}}$. The  equation   below is due to G. Neumann:


\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.3 Neumann's equation.}}
\emph{Assume that
$\sigma(T)$Êis not the whole complex plane.
For each pair 
$\lambda\neq\mu$   outside $\sigma(T)$ the operators 
$R_T(\lambda)$ and $R_T(\mu)$ commute
and}
\[
R_T(\mu)R_T(\lambda)=\frac{R_T(\mu)-R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}\tag{*}
\]


\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Notice that
\[
(\mu\cdot E-T)\cdot \frac{R_T(\mu)-R_T(\lambda)} {\lambda-\mu}
=
\]
\[
\frac{E}{\lambda-\mu}-(\mu-\lambda)\cdot\frac{R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}-
(\lambda\cdot E-T)\cdot \frac{R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}=R_T(\lambda)\tag{i}
\]
Multiplying to the left by
$R_T(\mu)$
gives (*) which  at the same time this shows 
that the resolvent operators commute.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.4 The position of $\sigma(T)$.}}
Assume that ${\bf{C}}\setminus \sigma(T)$ is non-empty.
We can  write (*) in the form
\[
R_T(\lambda)(E+(\lambda-\mu)R_T(\mu))= R_T(\mu)\tag{1}
\]
Keeping $\mu$ fixed we conclude that
$R_T(\lambda)$ exists if and only if
$E+(\lambda-\mu)R_T(\mu))$ is invertible
which implies that
\[
 \sigma(T)= \{\lambda\,\colon \frac{1}{\mu-\lambda}\in
\sigma(R_T(\mu))\} \tag{A.4.1}
 \]

 
 \noindent
Hence one  recovers $\sigma(T)$ via the spectrum of
any given  resolvent operator. Notice that (A.4.1) holds  even
when
the open component
of $\sigma(T)$ has several connected components.


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.4.2 Example.}}
Suppose that $\mu=i$ and that 
$\sigma(R_T(i))$ is contained in a circle
$\{|\lambda+i/2|=1/2\}$.
If $\lambda\in\sigma(T)$ the inclusion (A.4.1) gives some
$0\leq\theta\leq 2\pi$ such that 
\[
\frac{1}{i-\lambda}=-i/2+ 1/2\cdot e^{i\theta}\implies
1-i\cdot e^{i\theta}=\lambda(e^{i\theta}-i)\implies
\]
\[
\lambda=\frac{2\cdot \cos \theta}{|e^{i\theta}-i|^2}\in {\bf{R}}
\]

\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.4.3 Neumann series.}}
Let     $\lambda_0$  be outside $|sigma(T)$  and
construct the operator valued series
\[
S(\zeta)= R_T(\lambda_0)+ \sum_{n=1}^\infty
(-1)^n\cdot \zeta^n\cdot R_T(\lambda_0)^{n+1}\tag{1}
\]
It is clear that (1)
converges in the Banach space of bounded linear operators when
\[
|\zeta|<\frac{1}{||R_T(\lambda_0)||}\tag{2}
\]
Moreover,  the series expansion (1) gives
\[ 
(\lambda_0+\zeta-T)\cdot S(\zeta)=
(\lambda_0-T)\cdot S(\zeta)+\zeta S(\zeta)=E\tag{23}
\]
Hence
$S(\zeta)=R_T(\lambda_0+\zeta)$ and 
the  locally defined
series in (1) entail the complement of $\sigma(T)$ is open
where $\lambda\mapsto R_T(\lambda)$ is an 
analytic operator-valued  function.
Finally  (*)
in (A.3) and a passage to the limit
as $\mu\to\lambda$ shows that  this analytic function
satisfies the differential equation
\[
\frac{d}{d\lambda}(R_T(\lambda)=-R^2_T(\lambda)\tag{**}
\]

\centerline {\bf{A.5. Operators with closed graph.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Let $T$ be a densely defined operator. In the product $X\times X$
we get the graph:
\[ 
\Gamma(T)=\{(x,Tx)\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\}\tag{A.5.1}
\]
If $\Gamma(T)$  is a closed subspace of $X\times X$ we say that
$T$ is closed.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.5.1 Exercise.}}
Let $T$ be densely defined and assume
that 
$\sigma(T)$ is not the whole complex plane.
Show that  $T$ is automatically closed.
\medskip

\noindent
In the study of spectra we shall foremost
restrict the attention to 
closed operators.
Assume  that $T$ is densely defined and closed.
Let $\lambda$ be a 
complex number  
such that (i) holds in (A.1) for some
constant $c$ and 
the range of
$\lambda\cdot E-T$ is dense. 
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.5.2 Exercise.}}
Show that the closedness of
$T$ implies that  
the range of $\lambda\cdot E-T$ is equal to $X$ so that 
$R_T(\lambda)$ exists.
A hint is that  if $y\in X$, then the  density gives
a sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $\mathcal D(T)$ such that
$\xi_n=\lambda\cdot x_n-T(x_n)\to y$.
In particular $\{\xi_n\}$ is a Cauchy- sequence
By (i) in
(A.1) we have
\[
||x_n-x_m||\leq c^{-1}\cdot ||\xi_n-\xi_m||
\]
Hence $\{x_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence and
since
$X$ is a Banach space
there exists $x\in S$ such that $x_n\to x$.
But then $\{(x_n,T(x_n))=
(x_n,\lambda\cdot x_n-\xi_n)$
converges to $(x,\lambda\cdot x-y)$
and since
$T$ is closed it follows that $(x,\lambda\cdot x-y)\in \Gamma(T)$
which gives the requested surjectivity since
\[
T(x)=\lambda\cdot x-y\implies y=(\lambda\cdot E-T)(x)
\]
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.5.3 Adjoints.}}
Let $T$ be densely defined
but not necessarily closed.
In the dual space $X^*$ we get  the subspace
of  vectors $y$ for which   there exists a constant
$C(y)$ such that
\[
|y(Tx)|\leq C(y)\cdot ||x||\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{i}
\]
When (i) holds the density of $\mathcal D(T)$
gives  a unique vector 
$T^*(y)$ in $X^*$ 
such that
\[
y(Tx)= T^*(y)(x)\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{ii}
\]
One refers to $T^*$ as the adjoint operator of $T$ whose
domain of definition is denoted by
$\mathcal D(T^*)$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that $T^*$ has a closed graph.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.5.4 Closed extensions.}}
Let $T$ be densely defined
but not closed.
The question arises when
the closure of $\Gamma(T)$ is the graph of a linear operator
$\widehat{T}$ and then 
we refer to
$\widehat{T}$ as a closed extension of $T$.
A sufficient condition for the existence of a close extension goes as follows:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.5.5 Theorem.}}
\emph{If 
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ is    dense in  $X^*$ then $T$ has a closed extension.}
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Consider the graph 
 $\Gamma(T)$
and let 
$\{x_n\}$ and $\{\xi_n\}$
be two sequences in $\mathcal D(T)$ which both converge to a point
$p\in X$ while 
$T(x_n)\to y_1$ and $T(\xi_n)\to y_2$ hold 
for some pair $y_1,y_2$. We must rove that $y_1=y_2$.
To achieve this we take some
$x^*\in \mathcal D(T^*)$ which gives
\[
x^*(y_1)= \lim \,x^*(Tx_n)= \lim\,T^*(x^*)(x_n)= T^*(x^*)(p)
\]
In the same way we get $x^*(y_2)=T^*(x^*)(p)$. 
Now the density of $\mathcal D(T^*)$ gives $y_1=y_2$
which proves that
the closure of $\Gamma(T)$ is a graphic subset of $X\times X$
and gives the closed   operator $\widehat{T}$
with 
\[
\Gamma(\widehat{T})=
\overline{\Gamma(T)}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{A.5.6 Remark.}}
In general, let $T$ be closed and densely defined.
There may exist several  closed operators $S$
with the property that
\[
\Gamma(T)\subset \Gamma(S)
\]
Passing to  adjoint operators the
reader may verify that
the density of
$\mathcal D(T)$ implies that
\[ 
T^*= S^*
\]
hold for every closed extension  $S$.


\bigskip




\centerline{\bf{A.6 Operational calculus.}}
\medskip


\noindent
Let $T$ be densely defined and closed.
To each pair $(\gamma,f)$, where
$\gamma$ is a rectifiable Jordan
arc contained in
${\bf{C}}\setminus \sigma(T)$
and $f\in C^0(\gamma)$, there exists the bounded linear operator
\[ 
T_{(\gamma,f)}=\int_\gamma\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz\tag{A.6.1}
\]
The integrand has values in the Banach space of bounded
linear operators on $X$ and (A.6.1)  is calculated
by Riemann sums. Next, 
Neumann's equation  (A.3)
entails that
$R_T(z_1)$ and $R_T(z_2)$
commute for all pairs $z_1,z_2$ on $\gamma$.
From this it is clear that
if
$g$ is another function in
 $C^0(\gamma)$,
then  the operators
$T_{f,\gamma}$
and $T_{g,\gamma}$
commute. Moreover, for each $f\in C^0(\gamma)$
the reader may verify that
the closedeness of $T$
implies that
the range of
$T_{f,\gamma}$ is contained in
$\mathcal D(T)$ and 
\[
T_{f,\gamma}\circ T(x)= T\circ T_{f,\gamma}(x)
\quad\colon x\in \mathcal D(T)
\]


 

\medskip

\noindent
Next, let $\Omega$ be an open set of class $\mathcal D(C^1)$, i.e.
$\partial\Omega$ is a finite union of
closed differentiable Jordan curves. 
When
$\partial\Omega\,\cap \sigma(T)=\emptyset$
we construct the line integrals  (A.6.1)
for continuous functions on
the boundary.
Consider the algebra $\mathcal A(\Omega)$
of analytic functions in
$\Omega$ which extend to be continuous on the closure.
Each $f\in \mathcal A(\Omega)$
gives the operator
\[ 
T_f=
\int_{\partial\Omega}\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz\tag{A.6.2}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.6.3 Theorem.}}
\emph{The map $f\mapsto T_f$ is an algebra homomorphism from
$\mathcal A(\Omega)$ into a commutative algebra of bounded
linear operators on $X$ whose  image is  a commutative algebra of 
bounded linear operators
denoted by $T(\Omega)$.}

\medskip

\noindent
{\emph{Proof.}}
Let $f,g$ be a pair in $\mathcal A(\Omega)$. We must show the equality
\[
T_{gf}= T_f\circ T_g\tag{*}
\]
To attain this 
we choose  a slightly  smaller open
set $\Omega_*\subset\Omega$ which again is of class $\mathcal D(C^1)$
and each of it  bounding Jordan curve is close to one 
boundary curve in
$\partial\Omega$ and $\Omega\setminus \Omega_*$ does not
intersect $\sigma(T)$.
By Cauchy's theorem we can shift the integration to
$\partial\Omega_*$ and get
\[
T_g=
\int_{\partial\Omega_*}\, g(z)R_T(z_*)\, dz_*\tag{i}
\]
where we use  $z_*$ to indicate that integration takes place
along
$\partial\Omega_*$. Now
\[
T_f\circ T_g=
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, f(z)g(z_*)R_T(z)\circ
R_T(z_*)\, dz_*dz\tag{ii}
\]
Neumann's equation
(*) from  (A.3) entails that  the right hand side in
(ii) becomes
\[
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, \frac{f(z)g(z_*)R_T(z_*)}{z-z_*}
\, dz_*dz+
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, \frac{f(z)g(z_*)R_T(z)}{z-z_*}
\, dz_*dz=A+B
\tag{iii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Here $A$ is  evaluated
by first integrating with respect to $z$ and 
Cauchy's theorem gives
\[
f(z_*)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot 
\iint_{\partial\Omega }\frac{f(z)}{z-z_*}\quad\colon z_*\in\partial\Omega_*
\, dz
\]
It follows that
\[ 
A=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, f(z_*)g(z_*)R_T(z_*)\, dz_*
=T_{fg}
\]
Next, $B$ is evaluated when we first integrate with respect to $z_*$. Here
\[
\iint_{\partial\Omega}\frac{g(z_*)}{z-z_*}\quad\colon z\in\partial\Omega
\]
which entails that $B=0$ and the theorem  follows.
\medskip


\centerline {\bf{A.7 Spectral gap sets.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Let
$K$ be a compact subset
of $\sigma(T)$ 
such that
$\sigma(T)\setminus K$ is a closed
set in ${\bf{C}}$.
This implies that if $V$ is an open  neighborhood of $K$, then
there exists a relatively compact subdomain
$U\in \mathcal D(C^1)$ which contains
$K$ as a compact subset while $\partial U\cap \sigma(T)= \emptyset$.
To every such domain $U$ we can apply Theorem A.6.3.
If $U_*\subset U$ for a pair of such domains
we can restrict functions in
$\mathcal A(U)$ to $U_*$. This
yields an algebra homomorphism
\[
\mathcal T(U)\to \mathcal T(U_*)
\]
Next, denote by
$\mathcal O(K)$ the algebra of germs of analytic functions
on $K$.
So each $f\in \mathcal O(K)$ 
comes from
some analytic function in a domain $U$ as above.
The resulting operator $T_U(f)$ depends on the germ $f$ only.
In fact, this follows because if
$f\in \mathcal A(U)$ and
$U_*\subset U$ is a similar 
$\mathcal D(C^1)$-domain which again contains
$K$, then
Cauchy's vanishing theorem in analytic function theory
applies
to $f(z)R_T(z)$ in $U\setminus \bar U_*$ and entails that
\[
\int_{\partial U_*}\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz=
\int_{\partial U}\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz
\]
Hence there exists an algebra homorphism
from $\mathcal O(K)$ into a commutative algebra
of bounded linear operators on $X$
denoted by $\mathcal T(K)$.
The identity in $\mathcal T(K)$
is denoted
by $E_K$ and called 
the spectral projection operator
attached to the compact set $K$ in
$\sigma(T)$. By this construction one has
\[
E_K=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{\partial U}\, R_T(z)\, dz
\] 
for every open domain $U$ surrounding
$K$ as above.


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.7.1 The operator $T_K$.}} When $K$ is a compact spectral gap set of $T$
we set
\[
 T_K=TE_K
\]
This  is a  bounded linear operator  given
by
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{\partial U}\, z\cdot R_T(z)\, dz
\] 
where $U$ is a domain as above which contains  $K$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.7.2 Theorem.}} \emph{Identify
$T_K$ with a linear  operator on
the subspace $E_K(X)$. Then one has the equality}
\[
\sigma(T_K)=K
\]
\emph{Proof.}
If $\lambda_0$ is outside $K$ we can choose
$U$ so that $\lambda_0$ is outside $\bar U$
and construct the operator
\[
S=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{\partial U}\, \frac{1}{\lambda_0-z}\cdot R_T(z)\, dz
\]
The operational calculus gives
\[
S(\lambda_0 E_K-T)= E_K
\]
here $E_K$ is the identity operator on
$E_K(X)$ which shows that
$\sigma(T_K)\subset K$.


\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.7.3  Discrete spectra.}}
Consider 
a spectral set  reduced to a singleton set
$\{\lambda_0\}$, i.e.
$\lambda_0$ is an isolated point in
$\sigma(T)$. The associated spectral projection is denoted by
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ and
given by
\[
E_T(\lambda_0)=
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{|\lambda-\lambda_0|=\epsilon}\,
R_T(\lambda)\, d\lambda
\]
for all sufficiently small $\epsilon$.
Now
$R_T(\lambda)$ is an analytic function defined
in some punctured disc
$\{0<\lambda-\lambda_0|<\delta\}$
with  a Laurent expansion
\[
R_T(\lambda)=\sum_{-\infty}^\infty\, 
(\lambda-\lambda_0)^k\cdot B_k
\]
where $\{B_k\}$ are bounded linear operators
obtained  by residue formulas:
\[
B_k= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot
\int_{|\lambda|=\epsilon}\,  
\frac{R_T(\lambda)}{(\lambda-\lambda_0)^{k+1}}\, d\lambda
\quad\colon\,\epsilon<\delta
\]


\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that
$R_T(\lambda)$ is meromorphic, i.e. 
$B_k=0$ hold when $k<<0$,
if and only if there
exists a constant $C$ and some integer $M\geq 0$ such that
the operator norms satisfy
\[
||R_T(\lambda)||\leq C\cdot |\lambda-\lambda_0)^{-M}
\]
\medskip


\noindent
Suppose now that 
$R_T$ has a pole of some order $M\geq 1$ at $\lambda_0$
which gives a series expansion
\[
R_T(\lambda)=\sum_1^M\,
\frac{B_{-k}}{(\lambda-\lambda_0)^k}+
\sum_0^\infty\, 
(\lambda-\lambda_0)^k\cdot B_k\tag{i}
\]
Residue calculus gives
\[
B_{-1}=E_T(\lambda_0)\tag{ii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The case of a simple  pole.}}
Suppose that $M=1$. Then it is clear that
Operational calculus gives
\[
\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{|\lambda-\lambda_0|=\epsilon}\,
(\lambda-\lambda_0)R(\lambda)\, d\lambda=0\tag{iii}
\]
This vanishing and operational calculus entail that
\[
(\lambda_0E-T)E_T(\lambda_0)=0
\]
which means that the ragne of the projection operator
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ is equal to the kernel of
$\lambda_0\cdot E-T$, i.e. the set of eigenvectors $x$ for which
\[
 Tx=\lambda_0\cdot x
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The case $M\geq 2$}}.
To begin with residue calculus 
identifies (iii) with $B_2$ and at the same time operational calculus
which aftera reversed sign gives
\[
(\lambda_0E-T)E_T(\lambda_0)=-B_2
\]
Since $E_T(\lambda_0)$ is a projection which commutes with
$T$ it follows that
\[
E_T(\lambda_0)\cdot B_2= B_2\cdot E_T(\lambda_0)=B_2
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Show that if $M\geq 3$ then
\[
(\lambda_0E-T)^k\cdot E_T(\lambda_0)=(-1)^k\cdot B_{k+1}
\quad\colon 2\leq k\leq M
\]
Consider also the subspaces
\[
\mathcal N_k(\lambda_0)= 
\{ x\colon (\lambda_0E-T)^k(x)=0\}
\quad\colon 1\leq k\leq M
\]
and show that they are non-decreasing and
for every  $k>M$ one has
\[
\mathcal N_M(\lambda_0)=\{ x\colon (\lambda_0E-T)^k(x)=0\}
\]



\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.7.4 The case when
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ has a finite dimensional range.}}
Here  the operator $T(\lambda_0)= TE_T(\lambda_0)$
acts on this finite dimensional vector space
which entails that
the nullspaces $\{\mathcal N_k(\lambda_0)\}$ above are
finite dimensional and if $M$ is the order of the pole
one has
\[
(T(\lambda_0)-\lambda_0)^M=0
\]
So $\lambda_0$ is the sole eigenvalue of $T(\lambda_0)$.
Moreover, the finite dimensional range of $E_T(\lambda_0)$
has dimension equal to that of $\mathcal N_M(\lambda_0)$.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Recall l that finite dimensional subspaces appear as
direct sum compoinetns. So if
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ is finite dimensional there exists a direct sum decomposition
\[
X=E_T(\lambda_0)(X)\oplus E-E_T(\lambda_0)
\]
where  $V=E-E_T(\lambda_0)$ is a closed subspace of $X$.
Show that $V$ is $T$-invariant 
and  that there exists
some $c>0$ such that
\[
||\lambda_0x-Tx||\geq ||x||\quad x\in V\cap \mathcal D(T)
\]

\centerline {\bf{A.8  Carleman's inequality.}}
\bigskip

\noindent
In many applications one is interested to estimate the operator norm
of resolvent operators.
In this connection a useful result was
proved by 
Carleman in the article
\emph{Sur le genre du denominateur $D(\lambda)$
de Fredholm}
from 1917. 
Let us remark that the finite dimensional case 
in the theorem below
easily extends to
analogue results
for
operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
See Chapter XI
in [Dunford-Schwartz] an account and applications of
Carleman's
inequality in   Theorem A.8.1 below. First we recall:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{The Hilbert-Schmidt norm.}} 
Let $n$ be a positive integer
and $A=\{a_{ik}\}$ some
$n\times n$-matrix 
whose elements are complex numbers.
Set
\[
||A||= \sqrt{ \sum\sum\, |a_{ik}|^2}
\]


\noindent
where the double sum extends over all pairs
$1\leq i,k\leq n$.
Next, 
for a linear operator $S$
on ${\bf{C}}^n$
its \emph{operator norm} is defined by
\[
\text{Norm}[S]=
\max_x\, ||S(x)||\quad\text{with the maximum taken over unit vectors.}
\] 
Identifying a matrix $A$ with a linear operator on
the Hermitian vector space
${\bf{C}}^n$, it is clear that
\[
\text{Norm}[A]\leq ||A||
\]
Examples show that the inequality in general is strict.
Let
$\lambda_1\ldots,\lambda_n$
be  the unordered $n$-tuple of roots of
$\text{det}(\lambda\cdot E_n-A)$
with  eventual multiple  zeros  repeated.
The union of these roots give the spectrum
$\sigma(A)$.

\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.8.1 Theorem.}}
\emph{For each
non-zero 
 $\lambda$
outside $\sigma(A)$ 
one has the inequality:}
\[ 
\bigl|\prod_{i=1}^{i=n}\, 
\bigl(1-\frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda}\bigr )
e^{\lambda_i/\lambda}\bigr|\cdot \text{Norm}\bigl[R_A(\lambda)\bigr]
\leq |\lambda|\cdot \text{exp}
\bigl(\frac{1}{2}+ \frac{||A||^2}{2\cdot |\lambda|^2}\bigr)
\]
\medskip

\noindent
The proof requires some preliminary results.
First we  recall a wellknown  inequality due to  Hadamard which
goes as follows:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf {1. Hadamard's inequality.}}
\emph{For every matrix $A$ with a non-zero determinant one has the inequality}
\[
\bigl|\text{det}(A)\bigr|\cdot \text{Norm}(A^{-1})\leq
\frac{||A||^{n-1}}{(n-1)^{n-1)/2}}
\]



\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{2. Traceless matrices.}}
The trace 
of the $n\times n$-matrix $A$ is given
by
\[
\text{Tr}(A)= b_{11}+\ldots+b_{nn}\tag{i}
\]
Recall  that 
$\text{Tr}(A)$ is
equal to the sum of the roots of the characterstic polynomial
$\text{det}(\lambda\cdot E-n-A)$.
In particular the trace of two equivalent matrices are equal
which 
will be used to prove the following:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{3. Lemma.}}
\emph{Let $A$ be an $n\times n$-matrix whose trace is zero. Then there
exists a unitary matrix
$U$ such that  the diagonal elements of $U^*AU$ all are zero.}
\medskip


\noindent
\emph{Proof}. Consider
first consider the case $n=2$. 
Since  $A$ can be transformed to an upper tringular matrix
via a unitary transformation
in
${\bf{C}}^2$, 
it suffices to consider the case when the 
traceless $2\times 2$-matrix $A$
has the form
\[ 
A=
\bigl(\,\begin{matrix} a&b\\0&-a
\end{matrix}\,\bigr)
\]
where $a,b$ is a pair of complex numbers.
If $a=0$ the diagonal elements are zero and we can take $U=E_2$ to be the identity.
If $a\neq 0$ we consider a vector $\phi=(1,z)$ in ${\bf{C}}^2$.
Then $A(\phi)$ is the vector $(a+bz,-az)$ and  the inner product becomes:
\[
\langle A(\phi),\phi\rangle=a+bz-a|z|^2\tag{i}
\]
We can write
\[
\frac{b}{a}= re^{i\theta}
\]
where $r>0$ and then (i) is zero if
\[
|z|^2=1+se^{i\theta}\cdot z\tag{ii}
\]
With $z=se^{-i\theta}$
it amounts to find a positive real number $s$ such that
$s^2=1+s$ which clearly exists.
Now we get the vector
\[ 
\phi_*=\frac{1}{1+s^2}(1,se^{-i\theta})
\]
which has unit length and 
\[
\langle A(\phi_*),\phi_*\rangle=0\tag{ii}
\]
Now we can find another unit vector $\psi_*$ so that
$\phi_*,\psi_*$ is an orthonormal base in
${\bf{C}}^2$ and hence there exists a unitary matrix
$U$ such that $U(e_1)=\phi_*$ and $U(e_2)= \psi_*$.
If $B=U^*AB$ the vanishing in (ii) gives $b_{11}=0$. At the same time
the trace is unchanged, i.e. $\text{tr}(B)=0$ holds and hence
we also get
$b_{22}=0$. This means  that  the diagonal elements of $U^*AU$ 
are both zero as required.
\medskip

\noindent{\bf{The case $n\geq 3$}}.
For the
induction
the following is needed:
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Sublemma.} \emph{For each  $n\geq 3$
there exists some
non-zero vector $\phi\in{\bf{C}}^n$ such that}
\[
\langle A(\phi),\phi\rangle=0\tag{*}
\]

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
If (*) does not hold we
get the positive number
\[
m_*=\min_\phi\, \bigl|\langle A(\phi),\phi\rangle\bigr|
\]
where the minimum is taken over unit vectors in
${\bf{C}}^n$.
The minimum is achieved by some unit vector $\phi_*$. Let
$\phi_*^\perp$ be its orthonormal complement
and $E$ is the self-adjoint projection from
${\bf{C}}^n$ onto $\phi_*^\perp$.
On the $(n-1)$-dimensional inner product space
$\phi_*^\perp$ we get the linear operator
$B=E A$, i.e. 
\[ 
B(\xi)= E (A(\xi))\quad\colon\quad \xi\in \phi_*^\perp\tag{i}
\]
If $\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_{n-1}$ is an orthonormal basis in
$\phi_*^\perp$ then the $n$-tuple $\phi_*,\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_{n-1}$
is an orthonormal basis in ${\bf{C}}^n$ and since the trace of $A$ is zero we get
\[
0=\langle A(\phi_*),\phi_*\rangle+
\sum_{\nu=1}^{\nu=n-1}\, \langle A(\psi_\nu),\psi_\nu\rangle=
m+\sum_{\nu=1}^{\nu=n-1}\, \langle B(\psi_\nu),\psi_\nu\rangle\tag{ii}
\]
where we used that $E(\psi_\nu)=\psi_\nu$ for each $\nu$
and that $E$ is self-adjoint so that

\[
\langle A(\psi_\nu),\psi_\nu\rangle=
\langle A(\psi_\nu),E(\psi_\nu)\rangle=\langle E(A(\psi_\nu)),\psi_\nu\rangle
=\langle B(\psi_\nu),\psi_\nu\rangle
\]
Now (ii)  gives
\[ 
\text{Tr}(B)=-m
\]
Hence the $(n-1)\times(n-1)$-matrix which represents
$B+\frac{m}{n-1}\cdot E$
has trace zero. By an induction over $n$ we find a unit vector
$\psi\in \phi_*^\perp$
such that
\[
\langle B(\psi_*),\psi_*\rangle=-\frac{m}{n-1}
\]
Finally, since $E$ is self-adjoint we have already seen that
\[
\langle A(\psi_*),\psi_*\rangle=\langle B(\psi_*),\psi_*\rangle\implies
\bigl|\langle A(\psi_*),\psi_*\rangle\bigr |=\bigl|\frac{m}{n-1}\bigr |=
\frac{m_*}{n-1}
\]
Since $n\geq 3$ the last number is $<m_*$ which contradicts the minimal choice 
of $m_*$.
Hence we must have $m_*=0$ which proves lemma 6.5
\bigskip

\noindent
{\emph{Final part of the proof.}
Let $n\geq 3$. The Sublemma  gives unit vector $\phi$
such that
$\langle A(\phi),\phi\rangle=0$.
Consider the hyperplane
$\phi^\perp$ and the operator $B$ from the Sublemma  which now has trace
zero on this $(n-1)$-dimensional space. So by an induction over
$n$
there exists an orthonormal basis $\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_{n-1}$ in
$\phi^\perp$ such that
$\langle B(\psi_\nu),\psi_nu\rangle=0$ for every $\nu$.
Now $\phi,\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_{n-1}$
is an orthonormal basis in ${\bf{C}}^n$ and if $U$
is the unitary matrix which has this $n$-tuple as column vectors
it follows that the diagonal elements of $U^*AU$ all vanish.
This finishes the proof of Lemma 3.


 
\bigskip

\centerline{\bf{Proof Theorem A.8.1}}.



\noindent
Set $B=\lambda^{-1}A$ so that $\sigma(B)=\{ \lambda_i/\lambda\}$ and
$\text{Tr}(B)=\sum\,\frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda}$.
We also have 

\[
||B||^2=\frac{||A||^2||}{|\lambda|^2}\quad\text{and}\quad
\bigl |\lambda\bigr |\cdot \text{Norm}[R_A(\lambda)]=\text{Norm}[(E-B)^{-1}]
\]


\noindent Hence Theorem A.8.1 follows if we prove the inequality
\[
\bigl |e^{\text{Tr}(B)}\bigr|\cdot
\bigl|\prod_{i=1}^{i=n}\, 
\bigl[1-\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_i}\bigr ]
\cdot \text{Norm}
\bigl [E-B)^{-1}\bigr]
\leq \text{exp}\bigl[\frac{1+ ||B||^2}{2}\bigr]\tag{*}
\]


\noindent
To prove (*) we choose an arbitrary integer $N$ such that
$N>\bigl |\text{Tr}(B)\bigr|$ and for each such $N$ we define the linear operator
$B_N$ on the $n+N$-dimensional complex space with points 
denoted by $(x,y)$ with  $y\in{\bf{C}}^N$
as follows:
\[
B_N(x,y)= (Bx\, , \, -\frac{\text{Tr}(B)}{N}\cdot y)\tag{**}
\]


\noindent
The
eigenvalues of the linear operator $E-B_N$ is the union of the $n$-tuple 
$\{1-\frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda}\}$ and 
the $N$-tuple of equal eigenvalues given by 
$1+\frac{\text{Tr}(B)}{N}$.
This gives the determinant formula
\[
\text{det}(E-B_N)=
\bigl(1+\frac{\text{Tr}(B)}{N}\bigr)^N
\cdot \prod_{i=1}^{i=n}\, (1-\frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda}\bigr)\tag{1}
\]
The choice of $N$ implies that (1) is $\neq 0$ so 
the inverse $(E-B_N)^{-1}$ exists.
Moreover, the construction of $B_N$ gives
for any pair $(x,y)$ in ${\bf{C}}^{N+n}$:
\medskip
\[
(E-B_N)^{-1}(x,y)=
\bigl (E-B)^{-1}(x), \frac{y}{
1+\frac{1}{N}\cdot \text{Tr}(B)}\bigr)
\]


\noindent
It follows that 
\[
\text{Norm}\bigl[(E-B)^{-1})\bigr]\leq
\text{Norm}\bigl[
(E-B_N)^{-1}\bigr]\implies
\]
\[
\bigl|\text{det}(E-B_N)\bigr|\cdot \text{Norm}\bigl[(E-B)^{-1})\bigr]\leq
\bigl|\text{det}(E-B_N)\bigr|\cdot
\text{Norm}\bigl[
(E-B_N)^{-1}\bigr]\tag{2}
\]


\noindent 
Hadarmard's inequality
estimates the
hand side in (2) by:
\[
\frac{||E-B_N||^{N+n-1}}{(N+n-1)^{N+n-1)/2}}\tag{3}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Next, the construction of $B_N$ implies that its trace is zero.
So  by Lemma 3 we can find
an orthonormal basis $\xi_1,\ldots,\xi_{n+N}$
in ${\bf{C}}^{n+N}$ such that
\[ 
\langle B_N(\xi_k),\xi_k\rangle=0\quad\colon 1\leq k\leq n+N
\]


\noindent
Relative to this basis the matrix of $E-B_N$ 
has 1 along the diagonal and the negative of the
elements of $B_N$ elsewhere. It follows that the Hilbert-Schmidt norm
satisfies the equality:
\[
||E-B_N||^2=
N+n+||B_N||^2=N+n+||B||^2+ N^{-1}\cdot
|\text{Tr}(B)|^2\tag{4}
\]

\medskip

\noindent Hence, (1) and the inequalities from (2-3) give:
\medskip

\[
\bigl(1+\frac{\text{Tr}(B)}{N}\bigr)^N
\cdot \prod_{i=1}^{i=n}\, (1-\frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda}\bigr)\cdot
\text{Norm}\bigl[
(E-B)^{-1}\bigr]\leq
\] 

\[
\frac{\bigl(N+n+||B||^2+
N^{-1}\cdot
|\text{Tr}(B)|^2\bigr)^{(N+n-1)(2}}{
\bigl(N+n-1\bigr)^{N+n-1/2}}=
\frac{\bigl(1+\frac{||B||^2}{N+n}+
\frac{|\text{Tr}(B)|^2}{N(N+n)}\bigr)^{(N+n-1)/2}}{
(1-\frac{1}{N+n}\bigr)^{N+n-1/2}}
\]
\bigskip

\noindent
This inequality holds for
arbitrary large $N$.
Passing to the limit as $N\to\infty$  the definition of Neper's constant $e$
give

\[
\lim_{N\to\infty}\, \bigl(1+\frac{\text{Tr}(B)}{N}\bigr)^N=
e^{\text{Tr}(B)}
\]
and the reader may also verify that
the limit of the last term above is equal to
$\text{exp}\bigl[\frac{1+ ||B||^2}{2}\bigr]$ which finishes the proof of
(*) above and hence also of Theorem A.8.1.

\centerline{\bf{Hermitian integral operators.}}

\medskip

\noindent
Let us  describe some contructions from Carleman's cited monograph.
Here is the set-up:
Consider the compact set 
$\square=\{(x,y)\colon a\leq x,y\leq b\}$
in ${\bf{R}}^2$.
A Lebesgue measurable   and complex-valued function $K(x,y)$
is Hermitian if
\[
 K(y,x)= \overline{K(x,y)}
\]
We impose the condition that there exists a null set
$\mathcal N$ in $[a,b]$ such that
\[ 
\int_a^b\, |K(x,y)|^2 \, dy<\infty\quad\colon\,  x\in[a,b]\setminus \mathcal N
\]
Lebesgue theory gives
a non-decreasing sequence of
closed subsets $\{E_n\}$ of $[a,b]$ such that
\[
\int_{E_n}\, |K(x,y)|^2 \, dy\leq n\quad\colon x\in E_n\tag{1}
\]
To each $n$ we define the truncated kernel $K_n(x,y)$ which is equal to
$K$ on $E_n\times E_n$ and otherwise zero.
It follows that
\[
\int_a^b\, |K_n(x,y)|^2 \, dy\leq n\quad\colon a\leq x\leq b
\]
which  entails that
\[
\iint_\square\, |K_n(x,y)|^2\, dxdy <\infty\tag{2}
\]
Hence each $K_n$ yields a Hilbert-Schmidt operator on
the Hilbert space
$L^2[a,b]$ and is therefore compact.
Since $K_n$ also is Hermitian the eigenvalues are real.
Keeping $n$ fixed
one seeks all real numbers
$\lambda\neq 0$ for which there exists a non-zero
$\phi\in L^2[a,b]$ such that
\[
\phi(x)=\lambda\cdot \int_a^b\, K_n(x,y)\cdot \phi(y)\, dy\tag{3}
\]
At each eigenvalue
which can be  positive or negative,
the eigenspace may have 
dimension  $e\geq 2$, but it is always finite dimensional.
The Gram-Schmidt construction gives
an orthonormal family of eigenfunctions
$\{\phi_{\lambda_k}\}$ with  eigenvalues
$\{\lambda_k\}$, where  eigenspaces of
dimension $e\geq 2$ means that $\lambda_k$ is repeated $e$ times.
Expanding an arbitrary
function $h\in L^2[a,b]$
with respect to the orthormal eigenfunctions
and an eventual term which is $\perp$ to all
eigenfunctions with non-zero eigenvalues, 
Bessel's inequality gives
\[
\sum\,
\bigl|\iint_\square\, \phi_{\lambda_k}(x)\cdot h(x)\, dx \bigr|^2
\leq \int_a^b\, |h(x)|^2\, dx\tag{4}
\]
Following Hilbert one associates a spectral function
defined for $\lambda> 0$  by
\[
\theta_n(x,y;\lambda)=\sum_{0<\lambda_k<\lambda} \, \phi_{\lambda_k}(x)\cdot \overline{\phi_{\lambda_k}(y)}
\]
\[
\theta_n(x,y;-\lambda)=\sum_{-\lambda <\lambda_k<0} \, \phi_{\lambda_k}(x)\cdot \overline{\phi_{\lambda_k}(y)}
\] 
and finally 
$\theta_n(x,y;0)=0$.
Next, each $h\in L^2[a,b]$ has  an expansion
\[
h=\sum c_k\cdot \phi_{\lambda_k}
\]
With $\lambda>0$ one has 
\[
\iint_\square\, \theta_n(x,y;\lambda)\cdot h(x)\cdot
 \overline{h(y)}\, dxdy=\sum_{0<\lambda_k<\lambda}\, |c_k|^2
\]
\[
\iint_\square\, \theta_n(x,y;\lambda)\cdot h(x)\cdot
 \overline{h(y)}\, dxdy=\sum_{-\lambda <\lambda_k<0}\, |c_k|^2
\]
Moreover, keeping $h$ fixed,
weak star convergence applied to a conutable dense set
of $h$-functions gives  a subsequence $n_1<n_2<\ldots$ 
such that
there exists a limit 
\[ 
\lim_{k\to \infty}\, \iint_\square\, \theta_{n_k}(x,y;\lambda)\cdot h(x)\cdot
 \overline{h(y)}\, dxdy\tag{5}
 \]
 for each $h\in L^2[a,b]$ and every real $\lambda$.
Next, the construction of the truncated kernels give
a limit function defined on $E_*\times E_*$ by
\[
 \theta(x,y;\lambda)=\lim_{k\to \infty}\, \theta_{n_k}(x,y;\lambda)\tag{6}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{When is 
$\theta(x,y;\lambda)$ a spectral function for $K$.}}
So far the constructions were  straighforward.
There remains to analyze if
the $\theta$-function in (6)
yields an adapted spectral resolution of
the densely defined
integral operator attached toÊ$K(x,y)$ where  the limit in (5) is unconstrained.
The following sufficiency
criterion for this to be true goes as follows:
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}
\emph{The limit in (5) exists   as $n\to +\infty$ and
the $\theta$-function yields a spectral resolution of
the densely defined $K$-operator  under the condition that
the two equations below do not have non-zero $L^2$-solutions:}
\[
\phi(x)=
 i\cdot \int_a^b\, K(x,y)\phi(y)\, dy
\quad \colon \psi(x)=
 i\cdot \int_a^b\, K(y,x)\psi(y)\, dy\tag{*}
\] 
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
More generally, Carleman proved the existence of an adapted
spectral resolution if
the two equations in (*)  both give finite dimensional spaces with
equal dimension.
We refrain  from giving   details of the proof but
refer to
[Carleman] and 
the expositary 
article 
\emph{La theorie des equations intgrales singulirs} [
Ann. l'Institut Poincar Vol. 1 (1931)].
In ¤ xx we establish an "abstract version" of the theorem which
therefore includes a proof of the sufficiency result above.

\bigskip


\noindent
We are given s domain $\Omega$ in the family $\mathcal D(C^1)$ in the complex plane.
Let $a$ and $f$ be continuous functions on
$\partial\Omega$ where $a$ is positive.
Given $\epsilon>0$ we seek $u$ such thsat
\[ 
\Delta(u)=\epsilon\cdot u^2
\] 
holds in $\Omega$ whileÊ$u$ satisfies the Neumann-Poincar equation on
the boundsry with resepdct toÊ$a$ and $f$.
To find $u$ we try a series expansioin
\[
 u=u_0+\epsilon\phi-1+\ldots

where $u_0$ solves the ordfnisate NP-problem,.i.re. here
$u_0$ is haarmonic in $\Omega$.
For $\phi_1$ we find thst
\[
\Delta(\phi_1)=u_0^2\tag{i}
\] 
and on the boundary
\[
\partial_n(\phi_1)= a\phi_1
\]
So now one takes
\[
\phi_1= \iint_\Omega  G(p,q)\cdot u_0^2(q)\, dq+H
\] 
where $H$ is harmonic in $\Omega$ and $G$ the normalised Greens' function.
Then (i) holds
and passing to the boundary we have
\[
\partial_n(H)+\iint_\Omega  \partial_n(G(p,q))\cdot u_0^2(q)\, dq
\]
















\newpage

\centerline{\bf{A uniquneness theorem.}}

\bigskip


\noindent
Let $u(x,y,z)$ be defined in an exterior ball $U=\{x^2+y^2+z^2>r_*^2\}$
in ${\bf{R}}^3$. Suppose it satisfies
the equation
\[
\Delta(u)+\lambda\cdot u=0
\] 
for some real number $\lambda$ and  that
\[
\int_U\, u^2dxdydx<\infty
\]
Then we shall prove 
that there exists a constant $C$ such that if $S(r)=\{x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2\}$ then
\[
\max_{(x,y,z)\in S(r)}\, |u(x,y,z)|\leq \frac{C}{r^2}\quad\colon r\geq r_*
\]
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
We shall use Euler's angular variables $\theta,\phi$
where $0<\theta<\pi$ and $0<\phi<2\pi$. Let $n\geq 1$ and 
consider a spherical function $Y_n(\theta,\phi)$ on the unit sphere $S^2$
of some degree $n\geq 1$. 
For each $r>r_*$ we put
\[
 Z(r)=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi\, Y_n(\theta,\phi)\cdot  u(r,\theta,\phi)
 \cdot \sin\theta\, d\theta d\phi
 \]
 By a classic formula which goes back to Newton  and Euler, it followdsfrom
  (*)  that
 $Z(r)$ satisfies the the second order ODE:
 \[
 r^{-2}\cdot \frac{d}{dr}(r^2\cdot \frac{dZ}{dr})=
 (\lambda-\frac{n(n+1)}{r^2}\cdot Z=0
\]
 Its general solution is of the form
 \[ 
 Z(r)=\frac{c_1\cdot\cos(\sqrt{\lambda} r)+c_2\cdot\sin(\sqrt{\lambda} r)} {r}+
 \frac{B(r)}{r^2}
 \]
 where $c_1,c_2$ are constants and $B(r)$ is a bounded function as $r\to+\infty$.
Next, the caicvhy-Schwarz inequslity gives
\[
Z(r)^2\leq  
\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi\, Y^2_n(\theta,\phi)\cdot 
 \cdot \sin\theta\, d\theta d\phi\cdot 
 \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi\, \sin\theta u^2(r,\theta,\phi)\cdot 
\]
Since the $L^2$-integral if $Y_n$ is normalised to be one, it follows by integration that
\[
\int_{2r_*}^\infty \, Z(r)^2r^2\,dr\leq
\int_{U^*}|, u^2(x,y,z)\, dxdydz
 \]
 where $U^*=\{x^2+y^2+z^2\geq 4r_*^2\}$.
Hence the $L^2$-integrability of $u$ entails that
 the left integral is finite. But then we see that $c_1=c_2=0$ must hold in
(xx) which means that
\[
 r\mapsto r^2Z(r)
 \] 
 is a bounded function on $[2r_*+\infty)$.
 Morevoer, the function $b8r)$ is indenepdnet of the 
 normalised spherical function $Y_n$. Hence there is a constant
 $C$ such that
 
\[
\bigl|\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi\, Y_n(\theta,\phi)\cdot  u(r,\theta,\phi)
 \cdot \sin\theta\, d\theta d\phi\,\bigr|\leq \frac{C}{r^2}
\] 
hold for all $Y_n$.

\centerline{\bf{Some  non-linear equations.}}
\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{Introduction.}}
We announce and propose results in the 2-dimensional case and remark only that
similar  results can be posed  in  higher dimensions where the case $n=3$ is relevant.
The  Neumann-Poincar
equation amounts to find a harmonic function $u$ in a domain
$\Omega$ with $C^1$-boundary such that
\[ 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}= au+f\tag{1}
\]
holds on
$\partial \Omega$ where $a$ is a positive continuous function while $f$ is arbitrary.
The calssic result due to Neumann and Pioncar shows that (*) has a unique solution
$u=u_f$ which for a fixed $a$ depends in a linear fashion on $f$ and 
is expressed by a continuous
linear operator
on $C^0(\partial\Omega)$, i.e. 
here one uses that a harmonic function
is determined by its continuous boundary values.
In particular the maximun norm of $u$ is bounded above by
\[
C\cdot |f|_{\partial\Omega}
\] 
where 
$C$ is a constant which depends on the 
given  domain and the $a$-function.
It is tempting to
try to solve non-linear equations.
A general case goes as follows:
Let
$\phi(s)$ be a continuous
real-valued function with $\phi(0)=0$ and
$\phi(s)$ is strictly increasing when $s\geq 0$.
Now we ask if there exists a solution $u$
where the boundary equation (*) holds while
\[ 
\Delta(u)=\phi(u)\tag{2}
\]
in $\Omega$. So here $u$ will be  subharmonic.
One can also try to go further and
replace (2) by
an equation
\[
\Delta(u)=\phi(u)+g\tag{3}
\] 
where $g$ is a  continuous function in
$\Omega$.
Finally one can replace the linear boundary equation (1) by
a non-linear equation.
Keeping (2) we can for example ask if there exist solutions $u$
with the boundary value equation
\[ 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}(p)= F(u(p),p)+f(p)\tag{3}
\]
where $F(s,p)$ is a conti uous functionon
defined for 
$\{s\geq 0\}\times\partial\Omega$ satisfying
the conditions in Carleman's non-linear version of the Neumann problem.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
We  refrain from discussing the case when
$\partial\Omega$ is not smooth but mention only that
Carleman's thesis from 1916
contains  results which
cover cases where corner points appear in  Neumann's boundary value problem.
The strategy to analyze non-linear PDE-equations 
is to employ the homotopy method
introduced by Poincar, i.e. the idea is to
solve non-linear equations via infinite sytems of linear equations which arise
via series dependiing on suitable parameters where one
encounters a family of equations which becomes  "more and more "
non-linear.
Whether one can profit upon calculus
of variation is less clear.
Personally I think that precise estimates for linear equations together with
Poincar's method give the  optimal procedure
to study 
non-linear equations.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A specific problem.}}
Let $\Omega$
be  domain which belongs to
the family $\mathcal D(C^1)$ in the complex plane.
Let $a$ and $f$ be continuous functions on
$\partial\Omega$ where $a$ is positive.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Theorem.}}
\emph{Given $\Omega$ and a pair $(a,f)$ as above, there exists
$\epsilon_*>0$ such that
for each 
$\epsilon>0$ one can find  a function $u_\epsilon$ which satisfies}
\[ 
\Delta(u_\epsilon )=\epsilon\cdot u_\epsilon ^2
\] 
\emph{in $\Omega$ and the boundary equation (1).}
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Remark.}}
A special case is to take $\Omega$ as the unit disc
and $a=1$ while $f=0$.
So now
\[ 
\partial_n(u)=u
\]
is the boundary value equation.
If $u$ is a solution it is subharmonic in
$D$ and the boundary  value equation entails that
$u\leq 0$ in $D$.
If $u$ and $v$ are two solutions we set $g=u-v$. Now
\[
\Delta(g)=\epsilon(u^2-v^2)=\epsilon(u+v)\cdot g
\]
Here $u+v\leq 0$ so $g$ is superharmonic in $D$.
If $g$ takes a minimum at a point $p\in T$
we have $\partial_n(g)(p)\geq 0$
so the equation $\partial_n(g)=g$ entails that
thr minimum is $\geq 0$, i.e $g\geq 0$ in $D$ by 
the minimum principle for superharmonic functions.
Hence $u\geq v$ and since we can reverse the role the uniquneness follows.
Since the whole system of equations is invariant under
rotations, the uniqueness entails that a solution is a radial function if it exists. 
Hence one is led to
analyzie if there exists a function $y=y(r)$ defined for
$0\leq 0\leq 1$ which satisfies the equations above.
It means that
\[
 y''(r)+2xx=\epsilon\cdot  y^2(r)\quad\colon 0\leq r<1
 \]
 with 
 the boundary condition 
 \[ 
 y'(1)=-y(1)
 \]
 A solution -if it exists - is given by a series
 \[ 
 y(r)=-A+c_1r+c_2r^2+\ldots
 \]
 To be analyzed, i.e. do we get a convergent solution via a series if
 $\epsilon$ gets large ???
 
 \bigskip
 
 
\noindent
{\bf{The general situation}}.
To find $u$ in the theorem sbove
we try a series expansioin
\[
 u=u_0+\epsilon\phi_1+\epsilon^2\phi_2\ldots\tag{*}
\]
Above
$u_0$ solves the standard  NP-problem, i.e.
$u_0$ is harmonic in $\Omega$, and 
$\phi_1$ satsfies the equation
\[
\Delta(\phi_1)=u_0^2\tag{i}
\] 
with the boundary condition
\[
\partial_n(\phi_1)= a\phi_1\tag{ii}
\]
If $\phi_1$ has been found then
\[
 \Delta(\phi_2)=2u_0\phi_1
 \]
 while
 \[
 \partial_n(\phi_2)= a\phi_2
 \]
 In each step, $\phi_k$ is found by a recursion which
 will
 express
 $\Delta(\phi_k)$ in $\Omega$ while the boundary equations  are as in (ii).
 \medskip
 
 
 \noindent {\bf{Solution.}}
 To find $\phi_1$ we put
 \[
\phi_1= \iint_\Omega  G(p,q)\cdot u_0^2(q)\, dq+H
\] 
where $H$ is harmonic in $\Omega$ and $G$ the normalised Greens' function.
Then (i) holds
and the boundary equation (ii) becones
\[
\partial_n(H)+\iint_\Omega  \partial_n(G(p,q))\cdot u_0^2(q)\, dq=aH
\]
where we used that $G(p,q)=0$ when $p\in\partial\Omega$.
So here $H$ is found by the ordinary Neumann-Poincar equation, and
similar equations determine $\phi_k$ for every $k\geq 2$.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Convergence.}}
To check that the series solution (*) converges
if $\epsilon$ is small enough we need  a priori estimates.
In general, consider the equation
\[
\Delta(\phi)=A
\] 
where $A$ is a function  in
$\Omega$ and
on the boundary $\phi$ satisfies
\[ 
\partial_n(\phi)= a\phi
\]
Then 
\[
\phi=\iint_\Omega  G(p,q)\cdot A(q)\, dq+H
\] 
where $H$ is harmonic in
$\Omega$.
With a given $A$-function
 we define a 
function on
$\partial\Omega$ by
\[
p\mapsto\iint_\Omega  \frac {\partial G(p,q)}{\partial n}\cdot A(q)\, dq=A^*(p)
\]
where the inner normal derivative is taken with respect to $p$ for
each fixed 
$q\in\partial\Omega$.
Set 
\[ 
C=\max_{p\in\partial\Omega}\, \iint_\Omega  
|\frac{\partial G(p,q)}{\partial n}|\, dq
\]
This entails that
\[
\max_{p\in\partial\Omega}\,|A^*(p)|\leq C\cdot|A|_\Omega
\]
After $H$ is determined by the Neumann-Poincar boundary value equation

\[
\partial_n(H)=a\cdot H-A^*
\]
With 
\[
a_*=\min_{p\in\partial\Omega} \, a(p)
\] 
we know that there is a constant $C_1$ such that
\[
|H|_\Omega\leq C_1\frac{C\cdot |A|_\Omega}{a_*}= C_2\cdot |A|_\Omega
\]
So with the given lower bound
$a_*>0 $ for the positive boundary function $a$, there exists
a constant
$C^*$ such that the maximum norm
\[
|\phi|_\Omega\leq \frac {C^*}{a_*}\cdot |A|_\Omega
\] 
Here  $C^*$ only depends on the given domain
$\Omega$.
Applying a suitable
majorant series, thiess a priori 
estimates entail
that the series (*)
converges when
$\epsilon$ is sufficiently small.

\centerline{\bf{Spectral theory for linear operstors}}

\bigskip



\noindent
Let $X$ be a complex Banach space.
We shall consider densely defined linear operators, i.e. linear maps
\[
T\colon\mathcal D(T)\to X
\]
where $\mathcal D(T)$ is
as a dense subspace of $X$, and  called the domain of definition for
$T$.
To each such operator one associates  the graph
\[
\Gamma(T)= \{(x,Tx)\,\colon\, x\in \mathcal D(T)\}
\]
If this subspace of $X\times X$  is closed one refers to
$T$ as a densely defined and closed linear operator on $X$.
In general $T$ is unbounded, i.e.\[
\max_{x\in \mathcal D_*(T)}\, ||T(x)||=+\infty
\]
where the maximum is taken over
unit vectors in
$\mathcal D(T)$.
Recall that a straightforward application of
Baire's theorem entails that when
$\Gamma(T)$ is closed and $\mathcal D(T)=X$ then $T$
is a bounded operator, i.e. there exists a constant $C$ such thst
\[
||Tx||\leq C\cdot ||x||
\]
In the literature this result is called the closed graph theorem.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.1 Invertible  operators.}}
Let $T$ be   closed and densely defined.
Suppose that the range
\[
T(\mathcal D(T))=X\tag{i}
\]
and that there
exists a positive constant $C$ such that
\[
||T(x)||\geq c\cdot ||x||\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{ii}
\]
Now (i) gives
for each
$x\in X$ a unique vector $R(x)\in\mathcal D(T)$
such that
\[
T(R(x))= x\tag{iii}
\]
By this construction $R$ is defined on the whole of
$X$ and the inequality (ii) gives
\[
||R(x)||\leq c^{-1}\cdot ||x||\quad\colon x\in X\tag{iv}
\]
Thus, $R$ is a bounded linear operator
whose rsnge is equal to $\mathcal D(T)$.
Moreover, when   $R$ is applied to the left on both sides in (ii)
the reader can conclude thst
\[ 
R\circ T(x)=x\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{v}
\]
One refers to $R$ as the inverse of $T$. It is
denoted by $T^{-1}$. Notice thst 
\[
\Gamma(T^{-1})= \{(Tx,x)\colon\, x\in\mathcal D(T)\}
\]
and that the bounded opersator $T^{-1}$ is injective, i.e. its null-space is zero.
Conversely, let $S$ be a bounded operator whose kernel is 
zero and the range $S(X)$ is dense. Then
$S=T^{-1}$ where $\mathcal D(T)= S(X)$
and
$T\circ R(x)= x$ for every $x\in X$.
Hence one has a 1-1 correspondence between the family of bounded injective
operators with a dense range and the family of
closed and densely defined operators which
satisfy (i-ii) above.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.1.1 Remark.}}
When $T$ as above is densely defined and closed
the equality $T(\mathcal D(T))=X$ follows from
(ii) and the relaxed condition thst $T$ has a dense rsnge.
For assume this and consider some
vector $y\in X$.
By the density of the $T$-rsnge we find a 
sewuence $\{x_n\}$ in $\mathcal D(T)$ such thsat
\[
\lim\, ||Tx_n-y||=0
\]
Now (ii) entails thst $\{x_n\}$ is a Cauchy seqrunce and therefore
converges to a vector $x$.
Since $\Gamma(T)$ is closed it follows thst
$x\in\mathcal D(T)$ and $Tx=y$
which proves the
requested surjectivity.

\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{A.2 The spectrum $\sigma(T)$}}.
Let $T$ be closed and densely defined and let
$E$ denote  the identity operator on $X$. Each complex number
$\lambda$ gives  the densely defined
operator $\lambda\cdot E-T$. If is is invertible one says thst
$\lambda$ is a resolvent value for $T$ and we shall  use the notation
\[
(\lambda\cdot E-T)^{-1}= R_T(\lambda)\tag{A.2.1}
\]
The set
of non-resolvent vslues is denoted by
$\sigma(T)$ and called the spectrum of $T$.
It turns out that
$\sigma(T)$  is a closed subset of
${\bf{C}}$.
To prove this we analyze the resolvent operators
of $T$ where a major result is the following:
\medskip

\noindent

\noindent
{\bf{A.3 Neumann's equation.}}
\emph{Assume that
$\sigma(T)$Êis not the whole complex plane.
For each pair 
$\lambda\neq\mu$   outside $\sigma(T)$ the operators 
$R_T(\lambda)$ and $R_T(\mu)$ commute
and}
\[
R_T(\mu)R_T(\lambda)=\frac{R_T(\mu)-R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}\tag{A.3.1}
\]


\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
We have
\[
(\mu\cdot E-T)\cdot \frac{R_T(\mu)-R_T(\lambda)} {\lambda-\mu}
=\frac{E}{\lambda-\mu}+\frac{(T-\mu E)R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}
\]
\[
\frac{E}{\lambda-\mu}-(\mu-\lambda)\cdot\frac{R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}+
\frac{(T-\lambda E)R_T(\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu}=
R_T(\lambda)
\]
Multiplying to the left by
$R_T(\mu)$
gives (A.3.1) which  at the same time this shows 
that the resolvent operators commute.
\bigskip

\noindent
We can write (A.3.1) as
\[
(E+ (\mu-\lambda)\cdot R_T(\lambda)R_T(\mu)=R_T(\lambda)
\]
Let us fix a resolvent vslue $\lambda$ and let
$z$ be  a complex number such that
\[
|z|\cdot ||R_T(\lambda)||<1
\]
Then the bounded linear  operator
$E+ z\cdot R_T(\lambda)$ is invertible and we 
get the new bounded linear operator
\[
S(z)=(E+ z\cdot R_T(\lambda)^{-1}\circ R_T(\lambda)
\]
The reader can check that
$\lambda+z$ is a resolvent value and
one has the equality
\[
R_T(\lambda+z)= S(z)
\]
Hence the set of resolvent values contain the open disc of radius
$||R_T(\lambda)||$ centered at $\lambda$.
This proves that 
$\sigma(T)$ is closed.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.4 Exercise.}}
One 
can recapture $\sigma(T)$ via the spectrum of
a single resolvent operator where we assume
that 
${\bf{C}}\setminus \sigma(T)\neq\emptyset$.
Namely, fix some
resolvent value $\mu$. If $\lambda$ is another resolvent vslue
then (A.3.1) gives
\[
R_T(\lambda)(E+(\lambda-\mu)R_T(\mu))= R_T(\mu)
\]
The reader can check thst thisimplies that the bounded operator
$E+(\lambda-\mu)R_T(\mu)$ is invertible which means that
$\frac{1}{\mu-\lambda}$ is a resolvent value for $R_T(\mu)$, and then
conclude thst 
\[
 \sigma(T)= \{\lambda\,\colon \frac{1}{\mu-\lambda}\in
\sigma(R_T(\mu))\} \tag{A.4.1}
 \]
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{An Example.}}
Let $X$ be the Hilbert space $\ell^2$ whose vectors are  complex sequences
$\{c_1,c_2,\ldots\}$ for which $\sum\ |c_n|^2<\infty$.
We have  the dense subspace $\ell^2_*$ vectors such that
$c_n\neq 0$ only occurs for finitely many integers $n$.
If $\{\xi_n\}$ is an arbitrary sequence of complex numbers
there exists the densely defined operator $T$ on $\ell^2$
which
sends every sequence  vector $\{c_n\}\in \ell_*^2$ to
the vector $\{\xi_n\cdot c_n\}$.
If $\lambda$ is a complex number 
the reader may check that $\lambda$ is a resolvent vslued
if and only if
there exists a  constant $C$ such that
\[
|\lambda-\xi_n|\geq C\quad\colon n=1,2,\ldots\tag{i}
\]
Thus, $\lambda\cdot E-T$ has a bounded  inverse if and ony if
$\lambda$ belongs to the open complement of the closure of the
set
$\{\xi_n\}$ taken in the complex plane, and when
(i) holds then
$R_T(\lambda)$ is the bounded
linear operator on $\ell^2$
which sends $\{c_n\}$ to 
$\{\frac{1}{\lambda-\xi_n}\cdot c_n\}$.
Since
every closed subset of ${\bf{C}}$
is equal to the closure of a denumerable set of points our
construction  shows that the spectrum of a 
densely defined
operator $\sigma(T)$ can be an arbitrary closed set in
${\bf{C}}$. 

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.4.2 Another  Example.}}
Suppose that $i$ is a resolvent value and 
\[
\sigma(R_T(i))\subset\{|\lambda+i/2|=1/2\}\tag{i}
\]
If $\lambda\in\sigma(T)$ then (A.4.1) gives some
$0\leq\theta\leq 2\pi$ such that 
\[
\frac{1}{i-\lambda}=-i/2+ 1/2\cdot e^{i\theta}\implies
1-i\cdot e^{i\theta}=\lambda(e^{i\theta}-i)\implies
\]
\[
\lambda=\frac{2\cdot \cos \theta}{|e^{i\theta}-i|^2}\in {\bf{R}}
\]
Hence (i) entails that the spectrum of
$T$ is real. Converseley, using (A.4.1) the reader can check that if
$\sigma(T)$ is real then the inclusion in (i) holds.


\bigskip

\centerline{\bf{B. Operational calculus}}
\medskip

\noindent
Let     $\lambda_0$  be a resolvent value of $T$
and
construct the operator valued series
\[
S(z)= R_T(\lambda_0)+ \sum_{n=1}^\infty
(-1)^n\cdot z^n\cdot R_T(\lambda_0)^{n+1}\tag{1}
\]
It is clear that (1)
converges in the Banach space of bounded linear operators when
\[
|z<\frac{1}{||R_T(\lambda_0)||}\tag{2}
\]
Moreover,  from (xxx) one has
\[
S(z)= R_T(\lambda_0+z)
\]
Hence the resolvents of $T$ yield an
operator-valued   analytic function
\[
\lambda\mapsto R_T(\lambda)
\]
defined in the open complement of $\sigma(T)$.
Using Neumann's equation  the reader
can check that  this  function
satisfies the differential equation
\[
\frac{d}{d\lambda}(R_T(\lambda)=-R^2_T(\lambda)\tag{3}
\]
\bigskip

\noindent
{\bf{B.2 Some line integrals.}}
Let $\gamma$ be a rectifiable  Jordan arc
contained in
${\bf{C}}\setminus \sigma(T)$ and let 
$f\in C^0(\gamma)$, where $f$ in general is complex-valued.
Now there exists the bounded linear operator
\[ 
T_{(\gamma,f)}=\int_\gamma\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz\tag{B.2.1}
\]
The integrand has values in the Banach space of bounded
linear operators on $X$, where  (B.2.1)  is calculated
by Riemann sums. Next, recall that 
a pair of resolvent operators $R_T(z_1)$ and $R_T(z_2)$
commute for all pairs $z_1,z_2$ on $\gamma$.
From this it is clear that
if
$g$ is another function in
 $C^0(\gamma)$,
then  the operators
$T_{f,\gamma}$
and $T_{g,\gamma}$
commute. Moreover, for each $f\in C^0(\gamma)$
the reader may verify that
the closedeness of $T$
implies that
the range of
$T_{f,\gamma}$ is contained in
$\mathcal D(T)$ and 
\[
T_{f,\gamma}\circ T(x)= T\circ T_{f,\gamma}(x)
\quad\colon x\in \mathcal D(T)\tag{B.2.2}
\]


 

\medskip

\noindent
Next, let $\Omega$ be an open set of class $\mathcal D(C^1)$, i.e.
$\partial\Omega$ is a finite union of
closed differentiable Jordan curves. 
When
$\partial\Omega\,\cap \sigma(T)=\emptyset$
we can construct the line integrals  (B.2.1)
for each continuous function on
the boundary.
Consider the algebra $\mathcal A(\Omega)$
of analytic functions in
$\Omega$ which extend to be continuous on the closure.
Each $f\in \mathcal A(\Omega)$
gives the operator
\[ 
T_f=
\int_{\partial\Omega}\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz\tag{B.2.3}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{B.3 Theorem.}}
\emph{The map $f\mapsto T_f$ is an algebra homomorphism from
$\mathcal A(\Omega)$ into a commutative algebra of bounded
linear operators on $X$ whose  image is  
denoted by $\mathcal T(\Omega)$.}

\medskip

\noindent
{\emph{Proof.}}
Let $f,g$ be a pair in $\mathcal A(\Omega)$. We must show the equality
\[
T_{gf}= T_f\circ T_g\tag{*}
\]
To attain this 
we choose  a slightly  smaller open
set $\Omega_*\subset\Omega$ which again is of class $\mathcal D(C^1)$
and each of it  bounding Jordan curve is close to one 
boundary curve in
$\partial\Omega$ and $\Omega\setminus \Omega_*$ does not
intersect $\sigma(T)$.
By Cauchy's theorem we can shift the integration to
$\partial\Omega_*$ and get
\[
T_g=
\int_{\partial\Omega_*}\, g(z)R_T(z_*)\, dz_*\tag{i}
\]
where we use  $z_*$ to indicate that integration takes place
along
$\partial\Omega_*$. Now
\[
T_f\circ T_g=
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, f(z)g(z_*)R_T(z)\circ
R_T(z_*)\, dz_*dz\tag{ii}
\]
Neumann's equation
(*) from  (A.3) entails that  the right hand side in
(ii) becomes
\[
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, \frac{f(z)g(z_*)R_T(z_*)}{z-z_*}
\, dz_*dz+
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, \frac{f(z)g(z_*)R_T(z)}{z-z_*}
\, dz_*dz=A+B
\tag{iii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
Here $A$ is  evaluated
by first integrating with respect to $z$ and 
Cauchy's theorem gives
\[
f(z_*)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot 
\iint_{\partial\Omega }\frac{f(z)}{z-z_*}\quad\colon z_*\in\partial\Omega_*
\, dz
\]
It follows that
\[ 
A=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot
\iint_{\partial\Omega_*\times\partial\Omega}\, f(z_*)g(z_*)R_T(z_*)\, dz_*
=T_{fg}
\]
Next, $B$ is evaluated when we first integrate with respect to $z_*$. Here
\[
\iint_{\partial\Omega}\frac{g(z_*)}{z-z_*}=0\quad\colon z\in\partial\Omega
\]
which entails that $B=0$ and Theorem B.3  follows.
\bigskip


\centerline {\bf{B.4  Spectral gap sets.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Let
$K$ be a compact subset
of $\sigma(T)$ 
such that
$\sigma(T)\setminus K$ is a closed
set in ${\bf{C}}$.
This implies that if $V$ is an open  neighborhood of $K$, then
there exists a relatively compact subdomain
$U\in \mathcal D(C^1)$ which contains
$K$ as a compact subset while $\partial U\cap \sigma(T)= \emptyset$.
To every such domain $U$ we can apply Theorem B.3
If $U_*\subset U$ for a pair of such domains
we can restrict functions in
$\mathcal A(U)$ to $U_*$. This
yields an algebra homomorphism
\[
\mathcal T(U)\to \mathcal T(U_*)
\]
Next, denote by
$\mathcal O(K)$ the algebra of germs of analytic functions
on $K$.
So each $f\in \mathcal O(K)$ 
comes from
some analytic function in a domain $U$ as above.
The resulting operator $T_U(f)$ depends on the germ $f$ only.
In fact, this follows because if
$f\in \mathcal A(U)$ and
$U_*\subset U$ is a similar 
$\mathcal D(C^1)$-domain which again contains
$K$, then
Cauchy's vanishing theorem in analytic function theory
applies
to $f(z)R_T(z)$ in $U\setminus \bar U_*$ and entails that
\[
\int_{\partial U_*}\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz=
\int_{\partial U}\, f(z)R_T(z)\, dz
\]
Hence there exists an algebra homorphism
from $\mathcal O(K)$ into a commutative algebra
of bounded linear operators on $X$
denoted by $\mathcal T(K)$.
The identity in $\mathcal T(K)$
is denoted
by $E_K$ and called 
the spectral projection operator
attached to the compact set $K$ in
$\sigma(T)$. By this construction one has
\[
E_K=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{\partial U}\, R_T(z)\, dz\tag{B.4.1}
\] 
for every open domain $U$ surrounding
$K$ as above.


\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{B.4.2  The operator $T_K$.}} Let  $K$ be a compact spectral gap set of $T$
we put
\[
 T_K=TE_K
\]
This  is a  bounded linear operator  given
by
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{\partial U}\, z\cdot R_T(z)\, dz
\] 
where $U$ is a domain as above which contains  $K$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{B.4.3 Theorem.}} \emph{Identify
$T_K$ with a linear  operator on
the subspace $E_K(X)$. Then one has the equality}
\[
\sigma(T_K)=K
\]
\emph{Proof.}
If $\lambda_0$ is outside $K$ we can choose
$U$ so that $\lambda_0$ is outside $\bar U$
and construct the operator
\[
S=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{\partial U}\, \frac{1}{\lambda_0-z}\cdot R_T(z)\, dz
\]
The operational calculus gives
\[
S(\lambda_0 E_K-T)= E_K
\]
here $E_K$ is the identity operator on
$E_K(X)$ which shows that
$\sigma(T_K)\subset K$.


\bigskip


\noindent
{\bf{B.5 The case of   discrete spectra.}}
Suppose we have 
a spectral set  reduced to a singleton set
$\{\lambda_0\}$, i.e.
$\lambda_0$ is an isolated point in
$\sigma(T)$. The associated spectral projection is denoted by
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ and
given by
\[
E_T(\lambda_0)=
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{|\lambda-\lambda_0|=\epsilon}\,
R_T(\lambda)\, d\lambda
\]
for all sufficiently small $\epsilon$.
Here 
$R_T(\lambda)$ is an analytic function defined
in some punctured disc
$\{0<\lambda-\lambda_0|<\delta\}$
with  a Laurent expansion
\[
R_T(\lambda)=\sum_{-\infty}^\infty\, 
(\lambda-\lambda_0)^k\cdot B_k
\]
where $\{B_k\}$ are bounded linear operators
obtained  via residue formulas:
\[
B_k= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot
\int_{|\lambda|=\epsilon}\,  
\frac{R_T(\lambda)}{(\lambda-\lambda_0)^{k+1}}\, d\lambda
\quad\colon\,\epsilon<\delta
\]


\noindent
{\bf{B.5.1 Exercise.}}
Show that
$R_T(\lambda)$ is meromorphic, i.e. 
$B_k=0$ hold when $k<<0$,
if and only if there
exists a constant $C$ and some integer $M\geq 0$ such that
the operator norms satisfy
\[
||R_T(\lambda)||\leq C\cdot |\lambda-\lambda_0)^{-M}
\]
\medskip


\noindent
Let us now consider the case when 
$R_T$ has a pole of some order $M\geq 1$ at $\lambda_0$
which gives a series expansion
\[
R_T(\lambda)=\sum_1^M\,
\frac{B_{-k}}{(\lambda-\lambda_0)^k}+
\sum_0^\infty\, 
(\lambda-\lambda_0)^k\cdot B_k\tag{i}
\]
The reader should check thst
residue calculus gives 
\[
B_{-1}=E_T(\lambda_0)\tag{ii}
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{B.5.2 The case of a simple  pole.}}
Suppose that $M=1$. Then it is clesr that
\[
\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\cdot \int_{|\lambda-\lambda_0|=\epsilon}\,
(\lambda-\lambda_0)R(\lambda)\, d\lambda=0\tag{i}
\]
This vanishing and the operational calculus entail that
\[
(\lambda_0E-T)E_T(\lambda_0)=0\tag{ii}
\]
which means that the range  of the projection operator
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ is equal to the kernel of
$\lambda_0\cdot E-T$, i.e. the set of eigenvectors $x$ for which
\[
 Tx=\lambda_0\cdot x
\]
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{B.5.3 The case $M\geq 2$}}.
Now we suppose that a pole of order $M\geq 2$ appesrs.
Using residue calculus the reader
can check that
\[
(\lambda_0E-T)^k\cdot E_T(\lambda_0)=(-1)^k\cdot B_{k+1}
\quad\colon 1\leq k\leq M-1
\]
while
\[
(\lambda_0E-T)^M\cdot E_T(\lambda_0)=0
\]
Next, 
consider also the subspaces
\[
\mathcal N_k(\lambda_0)= 
\{ x\colon (\lambda_0E-T)^k(x)=0\}
\quad\colon 1\leq k\leq M
\]
and show that they are non-decreasing and
for every  $k>M$ one has
\[
\mathcal N_M(\lambda_0)=\{ x\colon (\lambda_0E-T)^k(x)=0\}
\]



\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{A.7.4 The case when
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ has a finite dimensional range.}}
Here  the operator $T(\lambda_0)= TE_T(\lambda_0)$
acts on this finite dimensional vector space
which entails that
the nullspaces $\{\mathcal N_k(\lambda_0)\}$ above are
finite dimensional and if $M$ is the order of the pole
one has
\[
(T(\lambda_0)-\lambda_0)^M=0
\]
So $\lambda_0$ is the sole eigenvalue of $T(\lambda_0)$.
Moreover, the finite dimensional range of $E_T(\lambda_0)$
has dimension equal to that of $\mathcal N_M(\lambda_0)$.
\medskip


\noindent
{\bf{Exercise.}}
Recall l that finite dimensional subspaces appear as
direct sum compoinetns. So if
$E_T(\lambda_0)$ is finite dimensional there exists a direct sum decomposition
\[
X=E_T(\lambda_0)(X)\oplus E-E_T(\lambda_0)
\]
where  $V=E-E_T(\lambda_0)$ is a closed subspace of $X$.
Show that $V$ is $T$-invariant 
and  that there exists
some $c>0$ such that
\[
||\lambda_0x-Tx||\geq ||x||\quad x\in V\cap \mathcal D(T)
\]

\centerline{\bf{C. Adjoints.}}
\medskip

\noindent
Let $T$ be densely defined
but not necessarily closed.
In the dual space $X^*$ we get  the subspace
of  vectors $y$ for which   there exists a constant
$C(y)$ such that
\[
|y(Tx)|\leq C(y)\cdot ||x||\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{i}
\]
When (i) holds the density of $\mathcal D(T)$
gives  a unique vector 
$T^*(y)$ in $X^*$ 
such that
\[
y(Tx)= T^*(y)(x)\quad\colon x\in\mathcal D(T)\tag{ii}
\]
One refers to $T^*$ as the adjoint operator of $T$ whose
domain of definition is denoted by
$\mathcal D(T^*)$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{C.1 Exercise.}}
Show that $T^*$ has a closed graph.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{C.2  Closed extensions.}}
Let $T$ be densely defined
but not closed.
The question arises when
the closure of $\Gamma(T)$ is the graph of a linear operator
$\widehat{T}$ and then 
we refer to
$\widehat{T}$ as the  closed extension of $T$.
A sufficient condition for the existence of this closed extension goes as follows:

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf{C.3  Theorem.}}
\emph{If 
$\mathcal D(T^*)$ is    dense in  $X^*$ then $T$ has a closed extension.}
\medskip

\noindent
\emph{Proof.}
Consider the graph 
 $\Gamma(T)$
and let 
$\{x_n\}$ and $\{\xi_n\}$
be two sequences in $\mathcal D(T)$ which both converge to a point
$p\in X$ while 
$T(x_n)\to y_1$ and $T(\xi_n)\to y_2$ hold 
for some pair $y_1,y_2$. We must rove that $y_1=y_2$.
To achieve this we take some
$x^*\in \mathcal D(T^*)$ which gives
\[
x^*(y_1)= \lim \,x^*(Tx_n)= \lim\,T^*(x^*)(x_n)= T^*(x^*)(p)
\]
In the same way we get $x^*(y_2)=T^*(x^*)(p)$. 
Now the density of $\mathcal D(T^*)$ gives $y_1=y_2$
which proves that
the closure of $\Gamma(T)$ is a graphic subset of $X\times X$
and gives the closed   operator $\widehat{T}$
with 
\[
\Gamma(\widehat{T})=
\overline{\Gamma(T)}
\]


\noindent
{\bf{C.4  Remark.}}
Let $T$ be closed and densely defined.
A closed operators $S$ is an extension of $T$ if 
\[
\Gamma(T)\subset \Gamma(S)
\]
Passing to  adjoint operators the
reader should  verify that
the density of
$\mathcal D(T)$ implies that
\[ 
T^*= S^*\tag{C.4.1}
\]
hold for every  $S$ as above.
